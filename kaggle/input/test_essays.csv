"Research is a crucial component of progress and development in almost every field, be it'science, technology, medicine, or social sciences. The results of research can be controversial and may not always lead to immediate practical applications, but they often contribute to our understanding of the world and guide future research. In my opinion, money spent on research is almost always a good investment, and in this essay, I will explain why I hold this view.

Firstly, research is essential for solving existing problems and for developing new solutions to emerging challenges. For example, medical research has led to the development of life-saving drugs and treatments for diseases like cancer, AIDS, and tuberculosis. It has enabled doctors and healthcare professionals to understand the biological mechanisms of diseases and to develop effective treatments. Similarly, scientific research has led to innovations in technology, such as smartphones, electric cars, and renewable energy sources, which have transformed the way we live and work. Without research, we would not have made the progress we have today, and we would not be able to address the complex challenges we face in the future.

Secondly, research leads to knowledge creation and dissemination, which is critical for the advancement of human society. The knowledge generated through research can be used to inform public policy, to educate the public, and to enhance our understanding of the world around us. For instance, social science research has contributed to our understanding of human behavior, attitudes, and beliefs, which has informed public policy and helped to address social problems such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination. Similarly, environmental research has provided us with insights into the impacts of human activities on the environment and has guided efforts to protect natural resources and biodiversity.

Thirdly, research often leads to unexpected discoveries and breakthroughs, even when the initial goals of the research are not met. For example, the discovery of penicillin, one of the most important antibiotics in the history of medicine, was the result of accidental contamination in a laboratory experiment. Similarly, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which confirmed the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe, was a by-product of research in radio astronomy. These serendipitous discoveries have often led to new avenues of research and unexpected benefits for society.

Finally, even when the results of research are controversial, they often contribute to public debate and discourse, which is essential for a healthy democracy. Controversial research can challenge existing assumptions and beliefs, and can lead to new perspectives and insights. For example, research on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has been controversial, with some arguing that GMOs pose risks to human health and the environment, while others argue that GMOs could be a solution to global food shortages. The debate on GMOs has led to increased public awareness of these issues and has informed public policy and regulation.

In conclusion, money spent on research is almost always a good investment, even when the results of that research are controversial. Research is essential for solving existing problems, for creating and disseminating knowledge, for unexpected discoveries and breakthroughs, and for contributing to public debate and discourse. While the benefits of research may not always be immediate or tangible, they are vital for the progress and development of human society. Therefore, investing in research is not only a wise choice but also an ethical obligation.

"There is no question that the internet has revolutionized learning and education. With access to such an incredible wealth of information, it's easier than ever for students to stay ahead in their studies. However, this vastness of knowledge can be overwhelming - finding reliable sources and organizing them into a cohesive essay can be daunting tasks. Fortunately, there are a few simple strategies that students can use to make sure they get the most out of the educational opportunities available on the web. First and foremost, it's important to find trustworthy sources when researching online. This means fact-checking any information taken from websites or blogs with other external sources like books or scholarly articles before incorporating them into an essay outline or draft. In addition, many universities also provide databases where students have free access to thousands of articles written by experts in various fields - these should always be consulted first whenever possible!. Second, organization is key when writing essays based on research conducted online. It may seem tedious at first but making lists of relevant topics as well as taking notes about each source during initial searches will save time later when attempting to write an organized paper using all this information gathered from different places across the web. Once everything is listed out clearly with its own category (i.e., facts versus opinions), piecing together paragraphs becomes much simpler!. Finally, staying focused while researching topics found online is essential; after all, it’s easy for one’s search queries to lead down multiple paths if not kept in check! One way around this problem is by simply setting aside dedicated time periods throughout each day specifically for looking up new material related only to one’s current topic; having such parameters makes it easier for minds wandering off course due overstimulation by unrelated information found elsewhere on the internet!. . Overall then, utilizing resources available through modern technology wisely requires more than just good luck; mastering certain strategies helps ensure success when trying tackle any academic assignment involving research via web browsers

"The importance of a good night's sleep for college students cannot be overstated. With numerous pressures and responsibilities to manage, it is often the case that those in higher education find themselves having difficulty getting enough rest each night. Poor sleeping habits can lead to a number of negative outcomes both academically and emotionally. It is crucial that university students recognize the benefits of adequate sleep and make conscious efforts to ensure they are sufficiently rested during their academic journey. From an academic standpoint, proper sleep allows college students to achieve optimal performance levels in all aspects relating to their coursework; this includes being better suited for following lecture content as well as researching material outside of class time efficiently. Memory retention, attention span, information recall and general cognitive functioning are also significantly improved with proper rest. Sleep deprivation has been found to diminish not only these abilities but energy levels as well; thus sapping motivation when completing assignments or studying for exams becomes more difficult than usual - leading potentially lower grades if no action is taken against it ahead of time. In addition, mental health issues can arise from inadequate amounts of sleep on a regular basis such as depression, anxiety or stress related reactions due to feeling overwhelmed by everything on one’s plate at any given moment coupled with exhaustion making matters even worse in some cases – especially among those already vulnerable due previous experiences prior coming into college life as well-known fact now days . To counteract such effects taking place it's important establish healthy sleeping patterns while attending school which will prevent burnout from occurring soon afterwards too since balance out stressors from daily dilemmas most likely experienced given amount knowledge required process thoroughly understanding subject matter itself . In order do so individuals could try couple things like forming strict bedtime routine (even weekends worth noting!) reducing caffeine intake after certain hour abstaining screen devices least few hours prior turning off lights improve quality shut eye obtained ; these simple steps alone have great deal impact overall productivity should taken seriously every chance get!. .

"Is a reading a message more important than you life?

Texting and driving why is people putting their lives and other people lives in danger to read a message. We will have to find a understanding of why people are texting and driving when it's against the law. Texting and driving started to evolve around 2013 and it also has become a huge distraction to those who can not stay off their phones. Some texting and driving accidents occurs almost every hour. Just last year the cell phone being used while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes annually. Also texting and driving causes more accidents then driving under the influence.

I believe people really don't think they can get into a car accident since they want to read and texting people back. Not only that you putting your life other the line you putting other people lives on the line. Plus it's against the law to text and drive also it has been banned in 47 states. The fine of texting and driving is $20 to $400 dollars. In the world right now 660,000 people attempt to use their phones while texting a driving but once again the cell phones distraction is alarmly high so they is a 75 percent chance that they will be on they phone the entire time while their driving then they try to hide their phone when the police ride past..

Everybody was or has used their phone while texting and driving but only a few has been caught everywhere around the world. Reasons why accidents occurs because the moment you look away you stop paying attention to the road. So you don't know if another car or person is coming down the street but the moment you look back up from your phone then it's too late. Example last year during my junior year we had a speaker come in and he told us how he lost his 6 year old daughter due to somebody texting and driving. He said ""the person that killed my babygirl would never know how this feels i almost lost both of my kids but i lost the youngest one"" You really should think and care about if you should be texting and driving because you can end lives and crush that person heart if you killed somebody in the wreck also you will go to jail for reckless driving. . If you know somebody that's always text and drive ask them if the care about their life. It don't matter if they're driving to school, work, the store, or even up the street. Losing a love is the worst feeling you can possibly deal with. Always try to help a friend or family because everyday is not promised so you try to help them instead of them risking their life by texting and driving.

It's going to be a time where a loved one experiences a texting and driving or either is involved in and texting and driving accident. There is a 50% chance that and texting and driving accident will take someones life. That's why it is best if you do not touch your phone while driving and make sure that you seatbelt is on. Like you see on billboards it be left unread than dead because it always a high chance of an texting and drive accident. Therefore don't be a victim of the texting and driving just wait till its a good time to use your phone then text them back.",0
"The idea of a car-free life has become more appealing around the world. In the United States, South America and across Europe, they have developed new ways of transportation that seem to be more beneficial. In these souces they explain the many advantages of limiting car usage such as its better for the environment and people find more alternative ways of transportation easier and cheaper.

There are many benefits to limiting car usage and the first is it improves the environment. In Source 1, it says that reducing car usage would be, ""A huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes"". Passengers in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and 50 percent in the United States. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. In that change recently,there has been many efforts to promote ""car reduced"" communities. In Source 2, Paris shows that they have made improvements in banning driving on certain days of the week due to smog. That smog cleared enough for the people to drive on days they were allowed to.

The second benefit to limiting car usage would be that people find more alternative ways of transportation easier and they are happier. ""When i had a car iwas always tense. Im much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. Many people expressed that other ways of transportation like biking or walking are much easier. In Source 3, it explains that Colombia has car-free days where they skate, bike, hike, or take buses instead. ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

In Source 4, it says that because of other ways of transportation are easier and cheaper, ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses each year."" It goes on to explain that ""Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed werent going to work anyway."" As more people become jobless, they find that taking buses or walking is much easier. That could be an advantage because Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company laid out a plan where cities in which ""pedstrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""

In conclusion, there are many ways in limiting car usage can be benefical such as with the enviroment, to the people, and it can change in the way this world operates. Living a car-free life would soon be very desirable in this world soon.",0
"The Author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents very well in this writting. Teh author is good at showing the two diffrernent sides to the agument but makes you agree with his stance. He used many diffrent examples and also gae a lot of detail in his writting.

To start off his essay with some facts and expalined what he was going to be talking about and some things about planets. One fact he used to start his essay off was "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" ( paragraph 3) This was a great way to start off the writting because he informed his readers about venus before he started to persaude them on a topic.

The author also displaces the oposing information which is always a good thing to do in a pusasive writting. An example of this is "" Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for human."" ( Paragraph 5) This is higlighing that yes Venus has some dangerous things but is still worthy. So by doing this he is showing the dangers but then can back them up and say some good things about them.

Following this, The author was really good at making the dangerous stuff sound not as bad, one example of this is ""Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely for above teh planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrated the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" (paragraph 6) This supports that he is a good authour and deplaning his stance on the agurmeny becasue he can make the other side information help his stance in an way.

In conclusion, the author did a great job at suporting his idea. The diffrent ways of supporting it made it seem more persasive and he got across alot of ideas and information.",0
"Exploring Venus has its pros and cons. Both have its challenges and risks. Venus is a very interesting planet to study due to the fact that it is the only one like earth, but there are risks. throughout this essay I will tell you my reasoning on why the author didn't exactly prove to me that Venus is worth taking risks for.

It states in paragraph two,"" Each mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in the more than three decadeas."" This peice of evidence shows that Venus is not a safe enviroment for electronics to land on so why would you potentially send humans to this planet even though a spacecraft couldn't surive. This statement also had no followup counterarguement; there was no sentence to make me want to change my mind.

It also states in paragraph three,"" On the planets surface, temperatures avergae over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" This piece of the paragraph again identifies the risks but now into more detail. There is no followup counterargument, so again this author is making me completely against the idea of sending life to Venus.

It states in paragraph four,""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This statement is one of the only pros that I have encountered from the author so far. This makes me think that this could be a good idea, especially due to the fact that Venus has some of the same features of earth.

The author then goes on to say,"" imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as out jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At the thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit. But the air pressure would be close to that of se level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This paragraph finally gives a safe solution to exploring Venus in a habitable way. However in the sixth paragraph the author states,"" Therefor, scientists seeking to conduct a throrough mission to understand venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" This statement shows how the trip to Venus would be a waste of time if you cannot get on the surface. There is no point doing this exploration because any human life will not survive if you get too close to the surface.

In conclusion the author did not convinve me that traveling to venus is worthy expidition. The author mainly explained the cons of the study and did not provide too many pros. The author did not support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",0
"The universe is a weird place. It is filled with places no one fully understands. Exploring those places that people do not fully understand is important. The author support the idea of studying Venus well.

The author gives good reasons by talking about what we could gain. In the text the author writes, ""not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". This sentence from the article helps support the claim by telling us we would gain insight in the planet. The sentence also helps support the claim by telling us the exploration of Veus would also make us more curious about space which will help with exploring other planets.

The author gives us information that we have already learned about Venus. In the text the author writes, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". This sentence from the article helps support the claim by telling us information to help support why we should explore. The sentence also helps support the claim by telling that the planet could have been like earth a long time ago which shows it might be habitable if we can learn to control the dangers.

The positives outweigh the negatives. In the the text the author writes, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface"". This sentence helps support the claim by saying if Venus is so bad why are we trying to find ways to explore it. The sentence also helps support the claim by showing that there is a reason to explore Venus.

The idea of studying Venus was well supported by the author. Exploring those places that people do not fully understand is important. It is filled with places no one fully understands. The universe is a weird place.",0
"When we ask for advice we usually ask multiple people instead of just one, but why do we ask multiple people? When people ask for advice, they usually talk to more than one person, I believe this is a great idea because you can see the majority of what people would do, learn from others past experiences, and you can see multiple views to decide which is best for you. We all have choices in life to make and sometimes we dont know what to do in that situation. Advice is what people tell us to give us a idea and better understanding of what we should do. Thats why we ask for advice in the first place so that we can have help to make our decision.

A amazing reason for asking many different people for advice is you can see the majority of what people would do. One very common way people decide on things is to take a majority vote. This simply means you find the most favored option among many people. These can be things as small as a class vote on movie day to things as big as elections. So if there is a big difference in the votes for each choice. Then you should chose the option that the majority of people would chose if you were basing your decision off of a majority vote.

Another great reason for asking many different people for advice is you can learn from others past experiences. Everyone makes mistakes in life. We can learn from others mistake so we don't make the same mistake. By asking about peoples past experiences we can fin out their mistakes with their choices. Also by finding out about people's past experiences we can learn from their successes. If people have had success going with a certain option or choice then that would be a good choice for us to make.

One last reason for asking many different people for advice is you can be exposed to a wide variety of views to decide the best option for you. Everyone is entitled to and has heir own opinion. Almost never is someones view on a topic or choice the exact same. The more people you ask for advice, the more possible choices you will be exposed to. This can better your understand of the topic and can help you make your choice in the end.

When people ask for advice, they usually talk to more than one person, I believe this is a great idea because you can see the majority of what people would do, learn from others past experiences, and you can see multiple views to decide which is best for you. In the end asking many people for advice can better your understanding and give you many reasons on which choice to make. This can help you form your own opinion and make your choice. So in conclusion, the more people you ask for advice, the better.",0
"Many believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. There are many conspiracy theories, but scientists say the Face is simply just a natural landofrm. Cydonia was first discovered in May of 2001, and since then has had people baffled by the human-like structure. Though it may be easy to believe that this landform is the creation of aliens on Mars, it is just a natural rock formation on the red planet.

Aliens not been proven to be living in the universe with a secret ancient civilization. Though some people might believe this is untrue, NASA has yet to find evidence to support it. If scientists knew Cydonia was created by aliens, they would definetly want to investigate this further. With this new information, just like any new discovery, it would open up so many different ideas about the universe that do not exist today. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger thatn the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were."" With the extremely advanced technology we have today, scientists have been able to take more pictures of this landform, further proving that it is a natural creation, and that there is no alien civilization hiding in the depths of it's shadows.

Cydonia has many conflicting opinions on how it was created. Many citizens still strongly hold on to their ideas about this landform. It has been proved by NASA that this formation is not created by aliens, nor is there any living organisms with secret colonies on Mars. People have the choice to believe what they want, but scientists know the truth behind the Face on Mars.",0
"When you drive a car you are putting out emisions that are harmful to your children or your family members. So when you think about you could do to limit that, the answer is in the question. When your child goes to school they should ride the bus or if close enought ride a bike or walk. As stated in Source 1:In German Suburb,Life Goes On without Cars; they have elminiated the facor of the building up of smog.

Now as that is a good thing,not everyone should have such restrictive laws or rules that make it almost useless to have. A car-free city that is losing money on the gas that is need to use the cars, are losing money and they are making the money back by feeing you when you dont listen to them. in paragraph 3,there is a quote that states - ""when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" that cant be intirely true. When foced to find a diffrent way to work,or school,or home you are putting a burdan on yourself and community.

You are putting stress on your body that can result in back,leg, and knee injury when you have to walk home. Not everyone is fit enough to walk home or to work or wherever you have to go.

In Source 2: Paris bans drving due to smog; they have fined 4,000 people for this issue they are trying to solve. It will never be solved. they are making more money while in the process of trying to eliminate he smog that will alway be there. But it sure has help with the congestion of the capital of France. It haas gone down by 60% after just five days. As they banned diesel fuel in france they have also lost the money that they need to be safe from the inpending fear of something horrible happening and making them lose money.

When you ban something that makes p for 67% of vehicles in france you must find a diffrent way to people from point a to point b in such a big city. When they have to use the subway or the bus or taxi there will need to be more of them so everyone can get on.

When fining people for there ""mistake"" of haaving their car in use the day of car free capital day,they are making money off of you and what are they going to spend it on? more tanks or weapons for there military? How about for the debt that they trying to pay off? In every country there is something that they need money for.

As in the Source 4: The End of Car Culture; ""the american love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling."" Many people will be losing there job because of what is going to happen when no one wants a car anymore. The reason older people still keep their license and car is because they know what it is like when you have to march your way to the store and buy food for your family and then lugg them all the way back by yourself.",0

This summer, I had the privilege of visiting a small village in South America. Although I had the opportunity to engage in a variety of activities while there, one of the most memorable experiences was learning how to make traditional pottery. I was amazed to discover how much time, hard work and patience goes into making just one pot. I was equally astonished by the intricate designs the potters were able to create. 

The process, which involved mixing clay with water and collecting materials from the local environment, taught me the value of craftsmanship and taking pride in one’s work. It also showed me that even with so few resources, one can still create something of beauty. Observing the dedication of the potters in the village and the joy in their faces when they were able to produce a successful pot, taught me that there is pleasure in working carefully and patiently and that you don’t have to be wealthy to be content. This experience has certainly changed me and I hope to take this lesson with me wherever life takes me.",1
"While technology that understands human emotions could potentially help teachers, the use of Facial Action Coding Systems to read students' expressions in the classroom raises some serious concerns.

On one hand, such technology may allow teachers to better recognize when students are struggling, bored, or disengaged so they can adapt their lesson accordingly. Identifying strong negative emotions could help teachers address bullying or other issues. And knowing when students truly understand or are excited by a topic may help guide instruction. 

However, this also creates risks to students' privacy and development. Constant monitoring of facial expressions could have a chilling effect and discourage natural emotional responses. Students may feel like they are under surveillance rather than in a nurturing learning environment. It also oversimplifies human emotion to think computers can definitively determine how someone feels based on facial cues alone. Moods and expressions are often more complex.

Rather than focus so intently on measurements and data, effective teaching is better served by strong interpersonal skills. Teachers need to foster genuine connection and trust with students to really understand their wellbeing and progress. Technical solutions should only supplement, not replace, compassionate human judgment and care for students' overall growth. If used without significant safeguards and oversight, this technology could compromise students' privacy and psychological safety at school. 

In many ways, students' emotional experiences are not for computers to analyze but for caring teachers, counselors, and parents to appreciate and address respectfully. Overall the risks seem to outweigh the potential benefits, suggesting this type of constant emotion-scanning in classrooms is not presently advisable and requires much more research on effects and protection of student welfare before being implemented.",1
"You grab your tray, belling rumbling, and look at the different options. You don't know what to choose, so you start asking the people around you. Asking for different opinions can help you make a difficult decision. Seeking advice from other people is good because it can help someone make better choices, it can expose you to different opinions, and have a better social life.

Asking for multiple opinions can help someone make better choices. It can lead to a better life with the decisions you've made with other people's advice. Most of the time people will give you good advice. With that good advice you'll be able to to make better decisions. Asking for different opinions can make choosing something quicker and easier. If your in a situation where you don't have a long time to choose what you want, then you should ask for advice from the people around you. That makes it quicker with getting a choice. Lastly, asking for multiple opinions can make you end up happy. When you get good advice it can make you happier because the outcome will most likely be good. Giving people good advice can make them have a better life with the choices they've made.

Having people tell them their advice can expose you to different opinions. It can help you in the long run if you have to make a decision with nobody around. When your in a situation where you have to make a hard choice, you can remember the advice that maybe your friends or family gave you to help you. When people tell you their advice it can give you a different mindset on things. Hearing someone say an opinion that you've never heard of or thought of can you give insight on the topic of advice. When you get different opinions from people it can lead to success. People telling you good advice can lead to success because you chose the right path. When people tell their advice to you, you'll get a variety of different opinions that help you.

Seeking multiple opinions can make you have a better social life. It can help you engage with other people. When asking for advice your talking and interacting with different types of people. Seeking multiple opinions is also good because it can make that person have more people to talk to. If your in a place where you don't know anybody, asking for advice can strike up a conversation and maybe even a new friend. The last way it can increase your social life is getting you comfortable with asking people for advice. Going up to a random person and asking them for advice can be nerve racking at first, but when you do it over and over again you'll get used to it. There are a variety of ways that looking for multiple opinions can build on your social life.

Asking for advice from many different people can benefit you. It can benefit you by making better choices, exposing you to different opinions, and to have a better social life. You should ask for advice because it can help you in many different ways.",0
"Not everyone in the world is able to accomplish their dream. There are so many obstacles that make a dream impossible and a lot of important things to give up in order to reach it. The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I agree with Winston Churchill because I also believe that failure, hope, and enthusiasm are the three keys to success in life.

First, all the things have two sides. the bad side and the good one, not everyone can see this two sides because of two simple reason. The first reason is because they do not try hard enough to find a solution. The second reason is because they loss their hope. Failure has two side but they are hard to see. The bad side of failure is that you did not reach that goal in your first or second try and you give up everything. The good side is that you fail but you learn a little bit on the way and that the next time you will be more close to reach that lovely goal.

Second, some things that i have learn from family, friends, and own experiences is that hope is the most powerful thing in the world. Most people tempt to lose their hope when they fail, while for others that maintain it can be more able to success. When I try something and I fail I always ask a question to my self. The question is What would I be without hope? When i answer that question I feel that all my strength and enthusiasm that I need for reaching that dream come to me.

Lastly,

a person can not reach a goal without been enthusiast. No one in the world would fight for something that is not interested on. Enthusiasm is what give you the strength and hope to keep trying until you success. Enthusiasm can also be lose by a person when they fail so many times. The thing that make people lose their enthusiasm is the time.

In conclusion, in order to be a successful person in life you need to make sure not to lose the three keys. Failure, that help you to gain experience, hope that help you to not give up, and enthusiasm that help you to keep trying. This are the three keys. Next time that you fail just thing about this three keys and you will be able to success in your life.",0

I am agree people need to make good decisions and they need to have good ideas for they life they need to have counselor for they can talk when people need to talk because somepeople need to have experiense for they life and they future sometime people can mot make good decisions and they need to talk with other person who have confidently for his can make that decision his have and his mind and they need to change the good decision with other person for they can thing about that decision some people take some position for make good ideas for change they life or future that more important and they life is matters what they think for have good family and they life. I agree with this because some people have alot problem and they life people and they can not make good ideas and good decision i hunderstand that because when we have problem and life is dificul to make good decision and make idaes some student have good decision and they make alot thing for they can help and they life because they think they want good future for they life and they want to make good ideas for they life because they want parent happy about good decision they have and they life because that ideas they have is more different of other student have good ides.

"I believe that children should be taught to cooperate, as it is the most beneficial way to live. Cooperation allows for a more efficient and effective society, as it leads to a greater degree of cooperation and communication. Cooperation also allows for a more equitable distribution of resources, as everyone benefits from working together.

One of the best ways to teach children to cooperate is through competition. However, competition should only be used as a tool to motivate children and to ensure that they are working hard. Too often, competition becomes a way to judge children and to put them down. This is not only harmful to the children involved, but it also has negative consequences for society as a whole.

One of the most harmful consequences of competition is that it can lead to a sense of entitlement. Children who are taught to compete often believe that they are entitled to win, and they become unwilling to cooperate. This can have a negative impact on their academic performance and their social lives.

In addition, competition can lead to a sense of rivalry. Children who are taught to compete often become competitive with one another, which can lead to conflict and animosity. This can have a negative impact on their relationships with their peers and their family members.

Finally, competition can lead to a sense of entitlement and a lack of empathy. Children who are taught to compete often become self-centred and insensitive to the feelings of others. This can have a negative impact on their social and emotional development.

Therefore, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate, rather than to compete. This is the most beneficial way to live, as it leads to a greater degree of cooperation and communication, a more equitable distribution of resources, and a better social and emotional development.

"Intro:
The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" believes that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. But, how well does the author support this idea? In this essay, I will evaluate the author's argument and use evidence from the article to support my claim.

Body:
Firstly, the author highlights the importance of understanding Venus's thick atmosphere, which is similar to Earth's but with a runaway greenhouse effect. This similarity makes Venus an ideal planet to study in order to better understand the effects of climate change on Earth. The author also mentions that Venus has volcanoes, mountains, and valleys that are similar to Earth's geological features,making it an interesting planet to explore. This shows that the author values the scientific benefits of studying Venus, despite the dangers.

Additionally, the author acknowledges the dangers of exploring Venus, such as the extreme temperatures, crushing pressure, and corrosive atmosphere. However, they also mention that scientists have developed technological innovations, such as the use of titanium and other materials that can withstand the harsh conditions, to overcome these challenges. This shows that the author recognizes the difficulties of exploring Venus but also believes that they can be overcome with the right technology and expertise.

Furthermore, the author notes that studying Venus can also provide insights into the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the universe. Venus, once a planet with oceans and a thick atmosphere, is now a barren wasteland, which suggests that life may have existed there in the past. This raises questions about the possibility of life existing on other planets that have similar conditions to Venus. The author recognizes the potential significance of studying Venus for the search for extraterrestrial life, making the pursuit of exploring Venus even more worthwhile.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the author effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. They highlight the scientific benefits of understanding Venus's atmosphere, geological features, and potential for life, while also acknowledging the technological challenges that come with exploring the planet. By providing evidence of the significance of studying Venus, the author makes a compelling argument for why it is worth exploring despite the risks. Therefore, the author's idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit is well-supported and valid.",1
"In today's world, we have become more reliant on visuals than ever before. With the advent of social media and technology, it has become easier for individuals to create an appealing image of themselves or their products. However, while creating an appealing image is important, it'should not be prioritized over the reality or truth behind it.

To begin with, an appealing image can be useful in attracting people's attention, but it is not the end goal. For instance, a restaurant may use attractive pictures of their food to entice customers, but if the food does not taste good, customers will not return. In this case, the appeal of the image may have brought customers in initially, but it is the quality of the food that will determine the success of the restaurant.

Similarly, people often create an appealing image of themselves on social media by posting pictures of their exotic vacations, luxurious cars, or expensive clothes. However, this image may not reflect the reality of their lives. In such cases, people may be living beyond their means, or the image they have created may not be sustainable in the long run. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize the reality or truth behind the image instead of getting caught up in the superficial appeal of it.

Furthermore, the overemphasis on creating an appealing image can also lead to the erosion of trust. For example, if a company uses misleading images or false claims to sell their products, customers may become skeptical and lose faith in the company. This loss of trust can have severe consequences for the company's reputation and long-term success.

On the other hand, prioritizing the truth behind an image can have significant benefits. For instance, companies that use authentic images and transparent marketing strategies tend to build stronger relationships with their customers. This is because customers value honesty and transparency and are more likely to trust companies that prioritize these values.

Moreover, focusing on the reality behind an image can also help individuals and companies to improve and innovate. Often, when we focus too much on the superficial appeal of an image, we may overlook or ignore the shortcomings or flaws in our products, services, or even ourselves. However, if we pay attention to the truth behind the image, we can identify areas for improvement and work towards making meaningful changes.

In conclusion, while creating an appealing image may be important in contemporary society, it'should not be prioritized over the reality or truth behind it. Instead, we should strive to strike a balance between the two, recognizing the importance of attracting attention while also valuing honesty and transparency. By doing so, we can build stronger relationships, improve ourselves and our products, and ultimately be more successful in our endeavors.

"Studying Venus, Huh? I agree, but it'll be too dangerous and very risky. But before that lets learn about Venus and whats its about. Tune in to find out!

In the article it states, ""Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest planets in the night sky, making it simple to catch in the night. In our solar system, Venus is right next to our sun. Venus is ovbisouly simple to see, but very hard to study it. Venus is called the Earth's twin, becuase of their size and density, density meaning how big and large it is. Venus goes at different speeds then the other planets.""

Now that you know somethings about Venus according to my sources, lets get into it if you should study it or not. Personally based on what I read, I would agree to study it up close. But, it'll be very dangerous. NASA is going to have to do a lot of work to get job done. It's not going to be easy, you can't just go up there and expect to study a large, massive planet. A lot of stuff goes into doing these type of things. Venus according to the article, ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Beyond high pressure and heat."" So, you can't just go up there with just any type of vehicle, spaceship, etc your going to have to do some serious moding... just an insane type of transpotportation to go up there.

In the article it sates, ""NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus."" They've tested some models an they actually worked. They just need to do little to a lot more work and the job will be done. To me, I feel like NASA can do it, I mean what can't they do. They think the impossible and create the impossible. Whoever are the people going up there... make it happen!

Therefore, I know it's a tough task, but I know they can do it. I mean, like I said, what can't NASA do. They think the impossible then do the impossible.",0
"The practice of yoga has become increasingly popular over the last several decades, and for good reason. As a holistic physical and mental discipline, it can be used to both relax and invigorate the body; reduce stress, anxiety, and depression; increase strength, flexibility, and endurance; improve overall health; cultivate mindfulness; foster creativity; enhance relationships with oneself and others; as well as help people face challenges in their life more effectively. With all these benefits making up its repertoire – it’s no wonder why so many people are drawn towards this ancient practice. When looking at yoga through a modern lens – specifically when using it to nurture one’s own wellbeing - there are various approaches that one can take. One common approach is Hatha Yoga: an umbrella term which encompasses all styles of physical yoga practices that involve postures (asanas) linked together with breath work (pranayama). Emphasis is placed on developing physical awareness while connecting with inner stillness simultaneously. This makes Hatha Yoga an ideal choice for those who wish to explore their relationship between body-breath-mind while experiencing the calming effects associated with vigorous movement meditation. Another type of approach found within traditional yogic philosophy includes Bhakti Yoga: a path devoted to cultivating love by dedicating oneself wholeheartedly to any form of devotion or spiritual service. It involves engaging in rituals such as chanting mantras/hymns & prayers as well as offering ones actions in service to something greater than themself like humanity or nature itself - also known as Karma Yoga . This particular branch seeks out emotional healing through conscious acts rather than relying solely on bodily posture mastery (like done within Hatha). In conclusion , although two vastly different approaches exist within traditional yogic philosophy , each serve practical purposes depending upon what individual goals someone may have set for themselves . Whether practicing Hatha or Bhakti , taking time out from daily life activities can prove beneficial if done diligently &

"Most people would like to think the ""Face on Mars"" is related to aliens in some way. However, that theory is highly unlikely. As in the in the article, the pictures from three different time periods, show different things, and each is more accurate than the other. It appears in the third picture (the most updated picture from 2001) that there is no face at all. It simply looks like a natural landform. The face was just shadows.

Even with the most updated and accurate picture from 2001, people still like to argue it could be a connection to alien life. Alien life has yet to be proven and is based off of theories, just like the face on Mars. These people are just ignoring the facts. My question is, why are people still basing there theory on an outdated and poor-pixlated picture when the newest one prooves its just a landform? I would like to think it has to do with fantasy. Most people get so stuck on something they wish were true just to make there life more entertaining, and most people like a little mystery as well. The thing is though that facts over-rule theories and perdictions.

According to the article, it says that with the newest picture, if there were something, we would've caught it in the picture. That is proof that it is only a landform. They even compare it to some of our landforms on earth, so I don't see how people still believe it could be something else. As I've adressed before, alien life isn't even prooven, so how could we be sure if this is connected to that all? We can't.

I would also like to adress shadows. In the first picture it had been said that they were only just shadows. There have been many instances of when we've seen shadows on objects and thought it looked like something else. This case isn't any different than that. We base most things on what we see rather than what it really is. It tells us in the article people have put the face in things such as movies, books, and magazines. For some reason people tend to feed into those things rather than whats really true. That goes along with the thing I said earlier about how people will believe what they want and pick the thing thats more exiting over whats logical.

There are facts and there are theories. Facts are what tell us that the 'Face on Mars"" isn't anything alien related just a natural landform. Kind of a dissapointment really.",0

Working collaboratively in groups is an essential part of life; it promotes efficiency, deepens understanding, and enhances relationships. Working in a group has several advantages compared to working alone, in terms of both productivity and understanding. 

Collaboration improvies productivity because it allows people to divide work into manageable tasks and specialize their skills. Instead of one person having to do the whole task, a group can use their collective skills and abilities to each do their part. This saves time and allows members to focus on what they're best at, which can result in better work in less time.

The communal aspect of collaboration promotes a deeper understanding of the task. Group members can bounce ideas off each other, hearing multiple perspectives and honing their understanding. This is especially true for more complex projects, as several views help to bring a clearer understanding to the topic. 

Working together also improves relationships between group members. It encourages communication, developing trust and strengthening bonds. These strong relationships foster an environment that promotes creative and effective collaboration.

In conclusion, working in a group setting has many advantages over working alone. Productivity can be increased, understanding can be deepened, and relationships can be strengthened. Collaboration should be encouraged whenever possible as it is an important and beneficial component of success.",1
"Drivers Should Not Use Cell Phones While Operating a Vehicle 

The use of cell phones by drivers has become very common in today's world. However, it presents a major danger and distraction when used while operating a motor vehicle. There are several key reasons why drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity when driving.

Safety should be the top priority while driving. When a driver is on a cell phone, whether talking or texting, their attention is divided between controlling the vehicle and their phone. This greatly increases the risks of an accident. Several studies have shown that driving while using a cell phone reduces the driver's attention level and increases reaction time similar to if not more than drinking and driving. Even hands-free cell phones require the driver's cognitive attention and can divert their focus away from the road. 

Driving is a complex task that requires full focus on one's surroundings. Glancing away from the road for even a few seconds, such as to check a text or make a call, endangers not only the driver but also other motorists, cyclists and pedestrians sharing the road. A lapse in attention or delayed reaction time could lead to catastrophic accidents. For this reason, many developed countries and some states have already instituted bans on cell phone use while driving that go beyond just texting. 

Allowing unrestricted cell phone use also sends a mixed message to the public, especially young and new drivers. If cell phones are permitted, it subconsciously reduces the perception of risk among drivers. This can foster reckless cell phone habits behind the wheel over time. Strong laws banning all cell phone activities except emergencies while driving are needed to change social norms and protect lives on our roadways.

In conclusion, the dangers of distracted driving from cell phone use have been clearly demonstrated. Drivers require their full and active attention to safely operate a vehicle. For the safety of all road users, cell phone use while driving should be prohibited through laws and policies. Safety must come before any non-essential cell phone activities when in control of a motor vehicle.",1
"On the contrary car crashes due to cell phone use goes up each year. People lose their lives daily by trying to do something that may be so simple to them. Maybe trying to change a song, text someone back, take a picture, etc. People do not realize that anything can happen in the blink of an eye. Just like that loved one of yours could be dead or severely injured. You should never be on the phone by any means while driving.

For this reason, I think you should always be hands-free while driving no matter what.

Think about ""Even at 60km/h, your car is travelling at more than 16 metres per second, so in those few moments your eyes were on a screen rather than the road you moved far enough to not see a motorcycle, a pedestrian, or someone braking suddenly in front of you.""You being on your phone while driving you put your life potentially at risk and other drivers. Causing us to have accidents that could have been avoided but now is a serious problem because someone may be hurt. A text message or skipping a song is worth more than your life or someones else. Therefore will driving always keep your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.

In addition, being on the phone while driving causes a two-second distraction. Increasing the chances of you being in a car crash. For instance, ""mobile phone use while driving increases your risk of accident by up to 400 per cent, points out that, in 2016 alone, police in NSW charged 39,000 people for doing so (100 drivers a day are busted for it in NSW and VIC)."" Just put your phones down and focus on the road. You don't want to be the person who may have killed someone loved one. You never know at the time if it may be more then one person was in the car at the time of the accident and someone may have gotten injured. Now you have to take responsibility in that situation when it all could have been avoided if you have chosen not to use your phone while driving.

Generally speaking, everyone knows right from wrong. Doing anything, in general, that may distract you even in less of a second is just something you shouldn't do. Innocent people have been killed or severely injured due to these kinds of things. Now someone may have just taken their last breath of fresh air, someone may have taken their last steps and is now paralyzed. This has been something that has been a problem for a while and should have been put a stop to it.

In the end, we all make our own decisions but deep down we know which one is right. No one wants to live with that guilt in their mind for the rest of their life knowing they were the reason someone's family or friend passed away. Don't be the reason, be the person who does the right thing and making it safer on the road for people.

"Do people vote for the man who runs the country. No, thats the Electoral Colleges job. The Electoral College is a process in which a numerous 538 electors cast there vote from the people of their state want as their president. The people have no interaction but to put in there ballet and choose there own electors who favor the candidate. Congress counts the votes, and if a total of 270 votes are cast for a candidate then they are elected president. For most people this how they think this is but it's not. Who chooses the Electors the answer is the state. So the sometimes the popular vote never wins, but that that happens rarely.

Many people like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole dislike the idea of Electoral College for this reason, the popular vote sometimes never wins. Al Gore who won popular vote but lost the presidency to Bush, lost the because of the Electoral College people believed that this was unfair and blamed the electoral college. But there is some benefits to the process, example is that if the people voted the states with the larges population would always keep the balance unchecked,or if there there is a tie in the popular vote we wouldn't have to rely on a thousand voters to decide. But the voters of the Electoral College to decide.

There are some draw backs to the process though. Since the number of electors are the based on the population of a state most state with few population numbers, careless about the election. There are reason why people find that we should keep the process,there are also reason many dislike the idea in the first place. Viewing the benefits and the weakness of the idea of the Electoral College made think that even though the College has flaws. Those flaws are rare and can be fixed, with proper work and planning.",0
"I strongly agree that students should have a good understanding of the topics. They should have a deeper knowledge of the concept and ideas. Whereas learning from facts can be additional to it but one cannot solely depend on that.

I strongly disagree that learning facts is the most important part of a student's education. Students should learn how to think critically and be able to apply their knowledge to solve real-world problems. They should also have the ability to communicate their ideas to others.

"It was a normal day at the lunchroom when I noticed a new girl standing in the lunch line. She started to walk to the empty lunch table where she sat by herself, because no one invited her to their table.""She smelled funky and looked funky too"" I thought to myself. I turned to my left to tell Generic_Name about the girl. I quietly whispered in her ear,""Do you see that new girl over there?"" She looked behind her back and gave her this nasty look. ""Should we go talk to her?"" I asked. ""No! she's not like us"" Generic_Name exclaimed. I listened to Generic_Name and never got the chance to talk to her, and now she's one of the most popular girls in the school. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they see from a different point of view, they hear other people's opinions on how the problem should be solved, and it makes them think twice about which advice suits them best.

The first reason for seeking multiple opinions is because you see from a different point of view rather than just one person. When I'm having a problem with something I always ask multiple people and see what they think I should do. For example when you go to the Ice cream shop and you always get Chocolate but you got bored from it. You ask your sister on whether you should try a different one this time and she tells you,""No, it's probably going to taste bad."" You end up getting Chocolate and it just doesn't taste good anymore. You regret not asking your parents. And you lost a chance of trying something different because just one person thinks it's not a good idea.

Another reason for seeking multiple opinions is to hear other people's opinions on how the problem should be solved. For example you are going dress shopping for Prom. You pick out a couple of dresses and try them on. You pick out your top two and ask your friends which one they prefer. Some picked the Red one and some picked the Purple one. You're torn on which one to get, but hearing other people's opinions helped you pick. Finally you decide to get the Red one because it was picked the most. Just listening to what other people have to say and the things they point out that you didn't notice help you make a better choice.

The final reason for seeking multiple opinions is that it makes you think twice about which advice suits you best. For example I'm in the store at the Smithsonian Zoo and I can pick one bracelet. The first bracelet has my favorite animal on it but it's not cool, and the second doesn't have my favorite animal on it but it's cool. It's a tough choice to make but you always have to think of what suits me best not what suits the other people best. I shouldn't just buy the first bracelet just because everyone thinks it's cool. If I like the other one better then I should stick with that.

It was a beautiful day during summer. I woke up feeling the warmth of the sun against my skin. I slowly got out of bed and went to brush my teeth and get dressed up. I had two choices to make. So I asked my parents and my sister if I Should wear noodle straps with jeans or a dress. Majority picked noodle straps with jeans, and so did I. It was a great choice because it was really hot outside. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they see from a different point of view, they hear other people's opinions on how the problem should be solved, and it makes them think twice about which advice suits them best.",0
"Should we accomplish more if we are always doing something. People who work's will get us new technology like, car's radio , TV.

"Phones have become the common distraction as of today. Everywhere you turn, there are phones in every hand either talking or texting even as people are driving. No one should be allowed to drive and be on their phone at the same time. People should be focusing on the road and not their phone because it's dangerous for other drivers on the road and themselves. There are many accidents that happen just because someone isn't paying attention to the road.

Phones shouldn't be allowed on the road as someone is driving because it can be dangerous for people that walk and can cause uncertain deaths.

Many people walk to their destinations to meet friends or to even go to work if it's close. They should be able to cross the road without having to worry about a car plowing them down. If someone is driving and they're focusing on their phone, they wouldn't be able to see the person walking across the street. A phone shouldn't have that much of a hold over you. A lot of deaths happen just from people not diverting all of their attention to the road. They're too busy typing on their phones, trying to send a message that could have waited until they reached where they were going. Another life gone down the drain all because a driver paid more attention to their phone than the road.

Drivers are distracted while they're on the phone meaning they aren't paying any mind to the cars behind or in front of them. Accidents can happen anywhere at any time of the day. There are so many car crashes that happen on the highways and most of the time, it is because the driver was on their phone. People can get injured or worse, they can die from the sudden impact of the crash. Therefore, drivers should keep their eyes and mind on the road to prevent the death of injury of someone else.

Phones are the biggest distraction to drivers as of today and they should be banned from use when driving. People believe that there are more drunk driving deaths than there are driving and texting deaths. Eventually, a law will have to be made to prevent driving while on you are on your phone. In other words, no one should use their phones while they're driving because of the horrible damage it could do to someone else.",0
"The Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that can detect human emotions. It's like a computer program that can read your face and know how you're feeling. Some people think it's a good idea to use this technology in classrooms to see how students are feeling. But, I don't think it's a good idea.

First of all, it's an invasion of privacy. Students should have the right to privacy in the classroom. If a computer is watching their every move and reading their emotions, it's like Big Brother is always watching. It's creepy and it makes me feel uncomfortable just thinking about it.

Secondly, this technology can't always be accurate. Sometimes people have poker faces or they might be feeling something that's hard to read. The computer might think someone is feeling happy when they're actually feeling sad. It's not always going to be right.

Thirdly, this technology could be used to label students. If a student is always showing anger or frustration, the computer might think they're a problem student. But, maybe they're just having a bad day or they're struggling with something personal. It's not fair to judge students based on their emotions.

Lastly, this technology takes away from the human connection. Teachers should be able to read their students' emotions and connect with them on a personal level. If a computer is doing it for them, it takes away from that connection. It's like a robot is teaching the class instead of a person.

In conclusion, using the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms is not a good idea. It's an invasion of privacy, it's not always accurate, it could label students, and it takes away from the human connection. Students should have the right to privacy and teachers should be able to connect with them on a personal level.",1
"Phones and Driving.

Today, many adults or teenage drivers are hooked onto their phones. While driving, they can be prompted to use their phones for text messaging. It may cause many accidents, death, serious injuries and more. I honestly think that drivers should use phones while driving because they are taking risks that could kill or injure others and also yourself. There are also laws against using a phone while operating a moving vehicle but people still disobey them. I think that there should be more consequences when it comes down to texting and driving.

Using your cell phones causes many distractions. It only takes a blink of an eye to cause an accident. Yeah, resisting the urge to text while driving may be hard but it can and will save lives including yours. When driving, your eyes and mind are programmed to be focused on the road at all times. Having a cellphone on your person is a hazard in my opinion. Just think about it, anyone could be crossing a busy street. The person walking is probably expecting you to slow down and obey the street laws. Meanwhile, you're responding to a text that could have waited, now you hit that person and he lost his life. All because of your cell phone.

Texting and driving needs to be taken more seriously now. It is so easy for someone to lose their life over a message. If there is a law for it then you follow that law because there is a reason for it being in full effect. Just imagine you lost a close friend or family member due to breaking the same law you once broke. The death toll in Georgia of people losing their lives to texting and driving drivers is 3,166. That number has increased dramatically ever since 2017. We could do so much better and help decrease that number to at least zero to little deaths. That is unacceptable, literally no one wants to have news broken down to them on how their mom, sister, brother, etc has died in a texting and driving incident.

People have their phones on every day. They act as if they cannot live without their cell phone. I get you need your phone for business, social media, long distance calling or texting but that can wait. People should take in consideration of others and just make the roads safer than what they should be. No one is so busy that they need to hurry and send a last minute text or answer a last minute phone call. I believe that everyone has patience and that they should use it.

We have come to a society where phones are more important than our lives itself. That should never be the case, if anything I personally think cellphones should be banned while in a motorized vehicle. Choosing to value a text message over your own life is showing us you have no respect for yourself or for others. They should be more considerate and put phones down and make sure they are paying more attention to the road.",0
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:

Limiting car usage has become a growing trend in many parts of the world, including Europe, the United States, and Colombia. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting alternative modes of transportation. By examining examples from Germany, France, and Colombia, as well as recent studies on shifting American behavior, it becomes evident that limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment.

Body Paragraph 1: Reduced Environmental Impact

Limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are mainly caused by passenger cars. According to the article, automobiles account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas of the United States. By promoting car-free communities and compact suburbs, the reliance on cars can be reduced, leading to a decrease in emissions. For example, Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, has seen a decrease in car ownership, with 70 percent of families not owning cars. This reduction in car usage directly contributes to a decrease in emissions.

Body Paragraph 2: Improved Quality of Life

Aside from the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can greatly enhance individuals' quality of life. The article highlights how residents of the car-free community in Vauban, Germany, have reported higher levels of happiness and reduced stress levels since giving up their cars. Walking and cycling become a more prevalent means of transportation, creating a healthier and more active lifestyle. By relying less on cars, people can enjoy cleaner and quieter streets, free from the noise and pollution associated with heavy traffic.

Body Paragraph 3: Enhanced Urban Planning

Limiting car usage also encourages urban planning that is conducive to walking, cycling, and public transportation. Instead of building sprawling suburbs with extensive parking spaces, new developments are being designed to prioritize accessibility and proximity to public transportation and amenities. This approach can create more vibrant, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods where stores, parks, and cultural institutions are within walking distance. By reducing the need for cars, space previously allocated for parking lots can be repurposed for green spaces, bike lanes, and community gathering areas.

Conclusion:

The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and extend beyond individual benefits to encompass environmental, societal, and urban planning advantages. By adopting a more sustainable approach to transportation, cities and suburbs can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve overall quality of life, and create more walkable and vibrant communities. The success of car-free communities in Germany, the implementation of driving restrictions in Paris, and the popularity of car-free days in Bogota demonstrate the feasibility and positive outcomes of limiting car usage. As attitudes towards car ownership shift and alternative modes of transportation gain popularity, it is imperative that societies embrace these changes and continue to prioritize sustainable and smart planning principles.",1
"Studying Venus Remains a Worthy Pursuit

The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a persuasive case that studying Venus is worthwhile despite the planet's hazardous conditions. The author outlines several compelling reasons why learning about Earth's closest planetary neighbor merits continued exploration efforts, in spite of the dangers involved. 

One key piece of evidence presented is that Venus offers scientists an opportunity to study how greenhouse gases drastically alter a planet's climate. With surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead and an atmosphere made almost entirely of carbon dioxide, Venus represents an extreme case of the greenhouse effect. Exploring Venus could help reveal the mechanics of runaway global warming, improving our understanding of climate change here on Earth. The article notes this scientific reward justifies enduring the planet's formidable atmosphere.

The author also argues that Venus may preserve geological clues about the early evolution of our solar system. As one of the inner planets closer to the Sun, Venus likely solidified from a magma ocean much like Earth. Discovering more about Venus's geological history could illuminate that of Earth and other rocky worlds. The article cites evidence from past missions that Venus may still have active volcanoes, making it crucial to follow up on those initial findings. 

While traversing Venus's inhospitable environment presents immense hurdles, the author makes a strong case that the scientific dividends of studying our sister planet are highly valuable. By illuminating climate change processes and offering a window into the development of terrestrial planets, Venus has much to teach us despite the risks involved in exploring it. For these compelling reasons, overcoming the difficulties to learn more about Venus remains a worthwhile scientific endeavor. The author presents a thoughtful evaluation of why probing this harsh yet enlightening world merits ongoing dedicated efforts.",1
"When people ask for advice they automatically just trust the opinion of others but also ask many others for their opinions and here is why...

People will trust an indavujal but not trust their opinion, Because the little part of you disagrees and that is natural you are two totally different people. You will go to others to weigh out their opinion and see which one is better you could get two opinions one person is foolish lets say you just asked them first. The other person is wise will you follow the first opinion or go seek out another. Which will be a wise opinion from a wise person or a opinion from a foolish person. However everyone wants a wise persons advice but what if that foolish person. Has a wiser moment in that opinion than the wise one, you will never know when one is truly wise unless. You take the time to see for yourself The foolish one may be the wiser one does not matter their intelligence the only thing that. Really matters is their opinion and the reason behind it so seek out both opinions and truly see which opinion fits the description of what your looking for in an answer. For example, if you only take one opinion than you wont have anything weigh out in the end. You dont only have to seek out only two you can do as many as you like just write them own and see which was is the best way to go.",0
"Cell phones have become an essential part of our daily lives, and it's not uncommon to see people using them while driving. However, the question remains whether drivers should be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving, and I'll explain why.

First and foremost, using a cell phone while driving is a significant distraction. When drivers are texting, calling, or browsing social media, they're taking their eyes off the road and their hands off the wheel. This increases the risk of accidents, which can lead to serious injuries or even fatalities. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was responsible for 3,166 deaths in the United States in 2017 alone.

Furthermore, using a cell phone while driving impairs a driver's reaction time. When a driver is distracted by their phone, they may not be able to react quickly enough to unexpected situations on the road. For example, if a pedestrian suddenly steps into the crosswalk, a driver who's texting may not be able to stop in time, which could result in a tragic accident.

Another reason why drivers should not use cell phones while driving is that it's against the law in many states. In the United States, 47 states have laws that prohibit texting while driving, and 16 states have laws that prohibit hand-held phone use while driving. These laws are in place because lawmakers recognize the dangers of distracted driving and want to protect the public from its risks.

Some people argue that drivers can use hands-free devices, such as Bluetooth headsets, to minimize the distraction caused by cell phones. However, research has shown that even hands-free devices can be distracting. A study by the University of Utah found that drivers who use hands-free devices are just as impaired as drivers who are holding their phones.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Using a cell phone while driving is a significant distraction, impairs reaction time, and is against the law in many states. While some people may argue that hands-free devices are a safe alternative, research has shown that they can still be distracting. To ensure the safety of all road users, drivers must keep their eyes on the road, their hands on the wheel, and their phones out of sight.",1
"Innovation and creativity are essential for progress and growth, but where do these ideas come from? Some people believe that truly innovative ideas only come from individuals working alone, while others argue that group settings are conducive to creative thinking. In my view, while both individual and group settings can generate great ideas, truly groundbreaking and original concepts often arise from individuals working alone. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why I believe this to be true.

Firstly, when individuals work alone, they are free from the pressures and limitations of group dynamics. Groups tend to value consensus and compromise, which can stifle creativity and originality. Members of groups often feel the need to conform to the group’s expectations, leading to a watered-down and less innovative end result. In contrast, when individuals work alone, they are free to explore their own interests and ideas without the need to please or compromise for others. This independence can lead to more unique and daring ideas that may not have been possible in a group setting.

Secondly, working alone allows individuals to fully immerse themselves in their area of focus. Group settings can be distracting and time-consuming, with members often needing to spend significant amounts of time discussing and debating different ideas. This can take away valuable thinking time from individuals and prevent them from delving deeper into their own ideas. In contrast, when individuals work alone, they are free to dedicate all their time and attention to their area of focus, allowing for a more in-depth exploration of their ideas.

Thirdly, individuals working alone are more likely to take risks and try new things. Group settings tend to encourage a more conservative approach, where ideas are evaluated based on their potential success and practicality. This can limit creativity and stunt the growth of truly innovative ideas. In contrast, when individuals work alone, they are more likely to take risks and try new things, as there are fewer external pressures to conform to the group’s expectations.

Finally, working alone provides the opportunity for individuals to develop a sense of ownership over their ideas. In group settings, ideas are often shared and developed collaboratively, leading to a lack of clear ownership over the final product. This can be demotivating and prevent individuals from fully investing themselves in the creative process. When working alone, individuals have complete ownership over their ideas, which can be motivating and empowering, driving them to work harder and achieve more.

In conclusion, while group settings can be useful for generating ideas and engaging in collaborative thinking, truly innovative ideas tend to arise from individuals working alone. By being free from the limitations of group dynamics, distractions, and external pressures, individuals can more fully explore their ideas and take risks that may not have been possible in a group setting. As such, individuals working alone are more likely to develop truly groundbreaking and original concepts that can change the world.

"I believe that traffic and housing problems in major cities would be solved by moving big companies, factories and their employees to the countryside. There are a few reasons for this.

First, by moving these large companies and their employees out of the city, they would be taking away the congestion and pollution that are often a problem in major cities. This would make it easier for people to get around, and it would also reduce the amount of energy that is needed to run these businesses.

Second, by moving these companies to the countryside, they would be able to take advantage of the available resources. This would mean that they would be able to produce more products, which would in turn create more jobs.

Finally, by moving these companies to the countryside, they would be able to live in a more rural environment. This would give them the opportunity to experience the natural beauty of the country, and it would also reduce the amount of stress that they would experience in the city.

"Have you ever been through a tough time? A death in the family, a bad athletic performance in your last sporting event, maybe you and your spouse just ended a lengthy relationship. Hard times, and the feelings that come with them should not be spread out for your peers to see. I disagree with the Facial Action Coding System. Kids and young adults should be able to hide their emotions becuase not everyone deserves to know how they feel.

Everyone has different feelings. Some negative, some posotive. If you are in class and your mom calls informing you that a loved one has been seriously injured and they are in critical condition, the feelings you have at that moment belong to you and only you. If you are in class and the coding system says that you are feeling 90 percent sad and 10 percent fearful, your classmates are ging to attack you with questions that could possibly worsen your mental state.

I understand that the system could increase test scores and grade averages, but the one thing that means the most is your security. Teachers' lives would be much easier due to the fact that they know which students need help and which students are soaking up the lesson well. There is just one problem. People (especially the youth) are insocure. Privacy is very important in this world and I believe the Facial Action Coding System would snatch that away from us.

All in all, there are pros and cons when discussing the coding system. More cons than pros in my opinion. The idea of feelings being released for everyone to see is too risky. If we unleash the beast into schools around the world, things could flip upside down.",0
"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become an increasingly popular topic of discussion in recent years, and for good reason. With the negative impact that car emissions have on the environment and the health hazards associated with increased air pollution, it is important to consider the advantages of reducing our reliance on cars. Several articles highlight the benefits of limiting car usage, including ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal and ""The End of Car Culture,"" also by Elisabeth Rosenthal. These articles provide evidence to support the advantages of reducing car usage, such as improved air quality, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and the creation of more sustainable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, releasing harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" it is stated that automobiles are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease air pollution and improve the quality of the air we breathe.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases contribute to global warming and climate change, which have far-reaching consequences for the environment and human health. The article ""The End of Car Culture"" mentions President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions and how a decrease in driving can contribute to achieving these goals. By driving less and finding alternative modes of transportation, such as biking or public transit, we can greatly reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more sustainable communities. The article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" discusses an experimental new district in Germany called Vauban, where street parking and driveways are forbidden, and car ownership is limited. This community promotes a car-free lifestyle by providing accessible public transportation and placing stores within walking distance. By designing communities that prioritize walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce our dependence on cars and create more sustainable and livable neighborhoods.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers several advantages, including improved air quality, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and the creation of more sustainable communities. The articles discussed provide evidence to support these advantages and highlight the importance of reducing our reliance on cars. By finding alternative modes of transportation and designing communities that prioritize walking and public transit, we can make significant progress towards a more sustainable future.",1
"Do you remember the days when playing outside was a daily routine? It's no secret that outdoor activities are beneficial for physical and mental health, but in the age of technology, many people have replaced outdoor recreation with sedentary activities such as gaming and television. Despite this shift, there is still much to be gained from engaging in outdoor activities. Playing outside has been shown to reduce stress levels, boost self-esteem and creativity, improve cognitive abilities including memory and problem solving skills as well as increasing physical strength. Studies have also demonstrated that children who engage in regular outdoor play tend to score better on academic tests than those who do not spend time outdoors. One way to maximize the benefits of playing outside is by participating in organized sports or recreational programs. These activities provide structure while allowing participants to enjoy themselves in an environment with minimal distractions from electronic devices or other forms of entertainment. In addition to providing physical exercise, these opportunities can allow individuals to build relationships through team dynamics which help foster cooperation and socialization skills important for success throughout life. Making time for unstructured play is equally important however; simply running around or exploring provide additional opportunities for creative outlets or developing motor skills without a focus on competition or performance outcomes -allowing participants freedom within their own boundaries . Relaxing outdoors allows individuals time away from screens and gadgets which further reduces stress levels while enjoying fresh air at the same time . . To reap all the benefits that come along with playing outside one must make it a priority over more sedentary options available today such as using mobile phones , watching TV ,or spending too much time online since all these may lead us down paths full of distractions instead of fulfilling experiences found out doors . Creating “technology free times” together helps families take advantage of valuable bonding moments while avoiding potential pitfalls associated with prolonged use of electronics -allowing everyone involved more quality family interactions rather than virtual ones!. . Playing outside provides numerous benefits beyond just exercise thus encouraging our

"When I was just learning how to play soccer I couldn't kick the ball correctly. Every single time I tried to my foot would slide under the ball causing the ball to go straight up in the air. Due to that disheartening fact I tended to get made fun of.....ALOT. I mean who can't kick a soccer ball correctly. So the best way I saw fit to help fix the problem at hand, was to ask the coach, my dad, and my best friend for advice. That would hopefully help me kick the ball better. So one thing I think is very important to help anybody learn is to ask more than one person for advice that in the future can help guide you into making better choices.

The number one person I confide in, if I ever have any kind of issue is my dad. He honestly is my rock. So as the situation arose. He was the first person I was going to talk to. So later that afternoon we walked outside and grabbed a ball. He watched me kick the ball about ten to twelve times. And, as I was doing this he never once laughed or judged me instead he gave me a helping hand and tried to help me work though the problem. Eventually he told me to stop and helped explain to me that my planter foot was not in the right place when I kicked the ball. So naturally, I asked him what the planter foot was and he patiently and carefully explained to me that the planter foot helped guide the ball to were it is supposed to go. That it was, the foot next to the soccer ball. Sadly try as I might his solution helped but didn't fix the problem as a whole. So as I walked back inside I started to plan who was the next best person that could help me solve the issue.

So the next stop in my quest to improve my kick, was my coach. As much as my father's advice had helped my kick the ball it still did not fix it. So as time when on I knew I was letting down my team by not being able to really kick the soccer ball. So the next time we had practice I emailed the coach and asked him to come fifteen minutes early to see if he could help with the pressing issue. Again he listened to my issue with interest and politely asked me to kick the ball so he could watch the way I kicked it to help detect the problem. So after about five minutes of watching me kick the ball he asked me if I could just do my run up to the ball but not kick it. So I did, the next thing he said surprised me, he told me that I was not running up to the ball correctly. Instead of coming to the ball from an angle to the kick the ball, I was standing right behind it and then trying to kick it. So just like the last time I started to use his method to see if that would help. In the end it made my kick stronger but it still was going straight up. So just as before, I sucked it up and started to think of the next person I could ask.

By then I could feel myself losing hope there was only one more person I felt like I could turn to who would not laugh at me because I could not kick a soccer ball. So the next day at school I went up to a girl named Generic_Name. She was my best friend and lucky for me she was one of the best girls on the soccer team. So as quietly as I could, so no one would here me, I asked her for help. Luckily she said that she was free after school and that we could meet up at her place to help work on the problem. So later that day I stood in her backyard with little to no hope. Her approach however was different from both the coach and my dad. She went though each step of kicking a soccer ball correctly and which situation calls for how much power, where you kick the ball, and what part of the foot you kick it with. So after a long explanation she asked me to show her the way I kick the ball. Of course even after all that the ball still went up in the air, I groaned. Then she stood up quietly and pointed to my foot and said, ""There.""

The place were I was gong wrong was which part of the foot I was kicking the ball with. I was trying to toe ball it the entire time. When in reality I needed to kick the ball with my laces. So I scurried off and went to look for another soccer ball. The next time I kicked the ball I made sure to kick it with my laces. I couldn't believe my eyes the ball went straight instead of up. I was super happy I ran over to her and gave her a huge hug. The next this thing Generic_Name said was, ""Don't thank just me, thank the people who got you to this point,"" of course as always she was right.

In the end I learned a valuable lesson for the problem, Which were advantages to asking more then one person for advice. Without the help from my dad, the coach, and of course Generic_Name, I wold have never been able to get there in the first place. After that I started to really understand the advantages of asking more than one person for advice. Without there advice I very might well have ended up quitting the sport that I now love. So without a doubt I think that asking more then one person will benefit you a lot more then asking just one person for advice to a problem. So the next time you feel like there is no one to turn to, or that no one else has faced the problem you are facing. Understand the possibilities that you may be giving away by not asking for advice from more then one person.",0
"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. It is important to study Venus because it is simular to Earth. It is closest to Earth by density and size. It is difficult to study because it is super hot. NASA is working on a plan to find out more about and explore Venus.

Venus is simular to Earth because they have streams like we do on Earth. They also have said there is a chance of life up there. Long ago Venus was probably covered with oceans. Venus has many things like Earth. They still have rocky surfaces and mountains and craters. Venus is also are nearest option for a planitary visit.

It is dangerous to be on Venus because it is so hot. Temperatures can average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric oressure is 90 times greater than what we experience. They could have erupting volcanoes and extreme weather. Another thing they could have is super powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning. They have a super thick atmosphere which could be dangerous to get to.

NASA is trying to find out things about Venus, so we can get new things to possibly go there in the future. NASA is trying to find something that can withstand the heat of it and stay there for a few hours. They could study the life there and find out about it. They want to get close and they think machines will help them do that.

"In today's fast-paced world, young people are often preoccupied with their own lives and goals, leaving little time for community service. While some may argue that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities, I believe that this is not entirely true. In this essay, I will explain why I disagree with this statement and provide examples to support my argument.

Firstly, young people are often involved in various extracurricular activities that benefit their communities. For instance, many high school students participate in volunteer programs that help the less fortunate, such as food banks, homeless shelters, and community centers. These programs not only provide valuable services to those in need but also teach young people important life skills such as teamwork, leadership, and empathy. Moreover, many universities and colleges require students to complete a certain number of community service hours before graduation, which encourages young people to get involved in their communities.

Secondly, young people are increasingly using social media and other online platforms to raise awareness and support for various causes. For example, the #MeToo movement, which started as a hashtag on social media, has brought attention to the issue of sexual harassment and assault, and has led to changes in laws and policies. Similarly, young people are using online platforms to raise awareness about climate change, racial injustice, and other social issues. While this may not involve physical volunteering, it is still a valuable contribution to the community.

Finally, it is important to recognize that young people face many challenges and pressures that may limit their ability to volunteer. For example, many young people are juggling school, work, and family responsibilities, leaving little time for community service. Additionally, some young people may face financial or transportation barriers that make it difficult to volunteer. Therefore, it is unfair to assume that young people do not care about their communities simply because they are not volunteering as much as we would like them to.

In conclusion, while it may be true that some young people do not give enough time to helping their communities, it is unfair to generalize this statement. Many young people are actively involved in volunteer programs, using social media to raise awareness, and facing their own challenges and pressures. Therefore, it is important to encourage and support young people in their efforts to contribute to their communities, rather than criticizing them for not doing enough.

"Somtimes i wish i could vote, then i could argue in favor of keeping the Electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. I will pick change to election by popular vote for the president of the US. I would pick that because the Electoral votes are anachronism,  it might choose the wrong person to run in office, and the Electoral votes are not fair.

The first reason why i would pick popular votes over the Electoral vote is because electoral votes are anachronism. anachronism means a person or a thing that seems to belong to the past and not to fit in the present. Source3 of the article 'In defense of the Electoral college"" states that ""The Electoral college is wildely regarded as an ""anachronism"",a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.

The soncond reason is that electoral votes might chose the wrong person to run in office. source3 part five of the article ""Indefense of the electoral college"" states that,""it can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the presidedent may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.""

The last reason why is because theElectoral votes are not fair. Source3 part 2 states that ""no region...has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" also source3 states that ""Electoral college method is not demovratic in a modern sense ...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. And source 2 states that ""the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.

In conclusion the electoral vote is un fair in many many ways. not only it chaets for others it does not let the people chose who to be president. POPULARITY votes are better than Electoral in many ways. and its modern.",0

"Dear State Senator,

I believe that you should stick with the electoral college, because i don't really care about any of this. But you wanted my opinion so i gave it to you. Also I say to stick with the electoral college is because i don't care enough to give a reason to change your voting to popular vote. I don't really knoe anything about the ellectoral college or populare vot, because you passage is to boring i couldn't get through half of it.

I also don't care to much for government. But if i did i would try to read the whole passage and give you a really good essay to read. But i don't and im not that sorry either and don't care. If your really want somones opinion you should ask someone who doesn't care ask one that does because then you would get a good answer but not from me.

Also next time you want to give me a passage don't give me one on the government. Because frankly no one im my grade will care because I certeny do not. But thats just my opinion. And i know that repeating things in an essay is bad but really, you need to give this passage to someone that care thats not me. And no one reallt cares about the fiasco in 2000 or any other year for that matter and you can't make them. Also if someone says that can't wright on a spicific topic belive them and try to change it please and thank you.

"It is often said that knowledge is power. In the modern world, knowledge is more important than ever before. As such, it is essential for students to learn both facts and ideas. While facts are important, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts.

Facts are the building blocks of knowledge. They provide the foundation for understanding more complex ideas. Without facts, it is impossible to understand the larger concepts. For example, in mathematics, students must learn the basic facts of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division before they can move on to more complex topics such as algebra and calculus. Similarly, in science, students must learn the basic facts of biology, chemistry, and physics before they can move on to more complex topics such as genetics and quantum mechanics.

However, facts alone are not enough. It is important for students to understand the ideas and concepts behind the facts. For example, in mathematics, it is important for students to understand the concept of a variable and how it can be used to represent a number. In science, it is important for students to understand the concept of the scientific method and how it can be used to test hypotheses. Understanding these concepts is essential for students to be able to apply their knowledge in real-world situations.

In addition, understanding ideas and concepts is essential for students to be able to think critically. Critical thinking is the ability to analyze a problem and come up with a solution. This requires an understanding of the underlying concepts and ideas. For example, in mathematics, students must understand the concept of a function in order to be able to solve a problem. In science, students must understand the concept of the scientific method in order to be able to design an experiment.

In conclusion, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Facts provide the foundation for understanding more complex ideas and concepts. Understanding these ideas and concepts is essential for students to be able to apply their knowledge in real-world situations and to think critically. Therefore, it is essential for students to learn both facts and ideas.

"Dear Florida senator,

I'm a young student, and no I don't have much of a background in political ideas or things, but I know we should keep the Electoral College. This old process was created to make electing a President easier and faster, which I believe it does.

Now, the Electoral College has 538 electors, but a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Some will argue that we aren't voting for a President but we're voting for the people, or electors, behind them. I would say that they aren't wrong, but we aren't just voting for those electors, we are voting for the whole idea behind their campaiging. We don't vote for the person, we vote for the idea that person agrees to carry out. By having this process, we can focus on getting swing states votes. The votes of these states matter the most, in my opinion, because they are likely to swing at any minute. As said in ""

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President

"", ""swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that the are going to decide the election."" This helps avoid run-on elections because the small states are likey to just vote for the most popular President, knowing their vote won't really make a difference.

Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that gives all of the electors to the winning candidate. However, there are a few states that have variation with the ""proportional representation"" idea. The ""winner-take-all"" system actually works really well. Other parts of the Electoral College has it's problems but not this one. With this process it makes it easy to give all of the votes to one person, this means all of the state will be on the same page and not fighting with itself. This process v. proportional representation, is better in my opinion because it's quicker and helps make the presidental process one step easier.

And lastly, it's a tradition to use the Electoral College. The pedigree for this process was created a really long time ago by some of the most outstanding leaders in our country. The article ""

What Is the Electoral College?

"" states that, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" The process we created as the United States, has its up and downs but it is one of the longest standing traditions we have. Hopefully you take my letter in to consideration. Thank you for reading.

Yours truly,

A young student",0
"The Electoral College is a method of voting for President and Vice President that was produced by our founding fathers in the articles of the Constitution. The Electoral College has been in use for centuries, but it is time that we disregard it. The Electoral College was a smart idea in the seventeen and eighteen hundreds, but as our country continues to change, it is necessary to change the way that we elect our leaders. The Electoral College has remained untouched and exactly the same for hundreds of years and this has caused it to be extremely outdated. Not only is it far too outdated and complicated to help our voting process, but the Electoral College does not give the voters voice instead, it takes it away from them. The Electoral College also can lead to concerning situations that the country and its people do not want to be put in. For these reasons, I strongly encourage you to make the change and switch to election by popular vote.

The question of whether or not to abolish or keep the Electoral College in tact is a heavily debated one, but it is clear that getting rid of the Electoral College will be highly beneficial to the voters of America. The Electoral College was established hundreds of years ago when our Constitution came about and it created a complicated process to elect the President and Vice President of the United States. Our country is changing day by day, and we certainly have made monumental changes since the Electoral College came to be. According to Bradford Plumer, author of, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" a poll was taken by gallop in the year 2000 that showed that less than just forty percent of Americans support the election system that we have now. This proves that it is time for a change and that the system that we currently have in place has been in place for far too long. The everchanging United States of America is in desperate need of an uptodate election system that fits the current needs of the American people. The Electoral College is not only outdated, but it is also an extremely complex voting method. In an article entitled, ""What Is the Electoral College,"" written by the Office of the Federal Register, it is explained that the Electoral College is a lengthy process that involves the choosing of electors and the issuing of Certificates of Ascertainment after both the people and the electors have voted. The Electoral College does far more harm than good for our country and for this reason especially, I believe that America should begin to elect its Presidents using the popular voting method.

Moreover, the Electoral College should no longer be the voting method of the American people because the people are given no voice with the Electoral College process. In his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer specifically states that the people themselves do not vote for their desired candidate, but instead, they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate. The people should be the ones who vote for the president because they will be the ones who are governed by the president. The Electoral College gives no voice to the people and is considered by many to be a nondemocratic way of voting and is often referred to anachronism. Today, it is a struggle to encourage people to vote and be present on election day because no one feels like their vote matters. People say that one vote doesn't make a difference and that there is no point in filling out a ballot if it has no real affect on which candidate is chosen. The Electoral College and the process it established is really just confirming these opinions. People do not feel like they are contributing because when it comes down to it, the electoral votes are the deciding votes. The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day. In order to make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice is being heard, and to increase voter turnout on election day, it is imperative that the country switches over to election by popular vote.

Most importantly, using the Electoral College as our voting method can lead to some serious problems. The replacing of electors that oppose the popular vote result is a problem that comes with using the Electoral College. Not only is it not hard to accomplish, but it has happened before. According to Bradford Plumer in his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" in the early 1960s, people who favored races being seperated in society were almost able to replace Democratic electors with a new set of electors who supported the opposite party. Also, some corrupt electors who are not pleased with the popular vote will simply vote for whomever they please. Electors clearly have trouble being trusted and there is obviously some extreme dislike for the system we have now. The Electoral College also causes some problems when instances like a tie in the electoral vote come about. In this case, a tie in the Electoral College would be thrown to the House of Representatives, who would then vote for the President. The Electoral College brings about uneccessary problems that could all be avoided if the country converted the way of electing to election by popular vote.

In summation, the Electoral College has been around for hundreds of years, but it is time that the United States makes the change that would improve the way of electing its future Presidents. The Electoral College is outdated and complicated, does not allow the voice of the people to be heard, and leads to uneccessary voting complications. For these reasons, I vehemently feel that we should switch from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.",0
"I would tell them that it was just a rock as said in the article ""huge rock formation"" ,i also can prove that it is not an alien because in the article it states that ""arrived at the Red Planet in sept 1997..."" they went to mars to take pics of the unknown formation to prove to everyon that it was not made by alien the NASA described it as an ""natural formation"" ,even though this still left others with questions NASA said ""the crema on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face "" which means that the picture wa not as clear as you thought it was with the clouds in the way NASA stated "" what the pictuure actually shows is the Martin equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West..."" These are all reasons that state that the landform was not created by aliens.",0
"Challenges of Expoloring Venus can be challenging to write about or understand. People often have different ideas/opion on this topic. Many people are indecievise though too. Which can lead to conflicting sides. His idea that it will be worthy it is not supported very well for a couple reasons.

His idea is not supported all that well. He used more of what he thought than facts. Such as this qoute "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

This qoute supports my idea because how does he know that there is insight to be gained on that plant. With that how does he know that human curiosty will lead us to equally endeavors. He needs to uses sources and support his sources. He even goes back to the dangerous that each one can lead to. He does not stay strong in just one idea, he circles back to the other idea. A qoute from the text that proves my point is "" Modern computers are enormously powerful and flexible and quick. but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

He always has a reason behind why it won't work or why it is dangroues. the author may feel like he needs to put why it wouldn work or the dnagerous but it just makes their writing weaker

In conclusion the author does not support his idea well. He has conflicting sides and he always seems to have a reasons why it could be dangroues. He also seems to have very little facts they are mostly just opions. The author needed to stick to one idea and find facts to support that reason. Intead of just going back and forth between ideas. This topic can be diffcult to write about if you do not understand it or have studied it in school.",0
"Cell Phones were invented in 1973, however, they weren't owned by the public until the 80s. Phone usage grew quickly after the first two decades, and now over half of the world population owns a phone. Considering cell phones haven't been around for a long time, they have become a main part of our lives, and we rely on them for simple daily activities. The growth of cell phones could be from how easy it is to reach someone within seconds no matter their location. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: phone calls, sending text messages, emails, surfing the internet, and performing other tasks. But unfortunately, many of these daily activities also occur while a person is driving. As a result, there's an increase in accidents and fatalities because of the use of cell phones while driving. Cell phone usage while driving should be banned because it's a distraction, causes erratic and aggressive driving, and is the main cause of accidents.

While driving, total concentration and procedures are needed, and using a cell phone compromises the focus needed. When driving both hands should be kept on the steering wheel because it has been proving more effective. However, when you're on the phone you don't have both hard on the wheel. Even though some people use bluetooth headsets it still affects your attentiveness. Using a phone while driving causes drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel, their minds off the road and the surrounding situation, and take their eyes off the road.

When driving you shouldn't have any distractions such as cell phones, because they can cause a change to your driving pattern.

Because using a cell phone while driving is such a distraction, it can cause the driver to drive erratically. Being on the phone may cause the driver to fail to give the right signals, miss road signs, or respond slowly to situations. These patterns can be very treacherous to others driving and pedestrians. Cell phones can also change the drivers' behavior depending on the conversation or what the driver is doing on their phone. Drivers experiencing emotional or stressful conversations may behave more aggressively, possibly causing road rage and accidents. Even though most drivers believe they can multitask, many of them are getting distracted and their driving patterns are changing, causing them to have accidents.

Many accidents are caused by those using their cell phones while driving. There are about 1.6 million accidents caused by phone use, which is roughly six times more than accidents caused by drunk drivers. In 2011, it was reported that 23% of all car accidents each year involve cell phone use. The National Safety Council reports that 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the

U.S. is caused by drivers using cell phones. Leaving about 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by being on the phone while driving. Cell phone use causes many accidents because of the distractions it causes and should be illegal to use while driving.

Cell phones have quickly spread and became a major part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything, making us rely on them heavily. However, we are using phones while driving, which is causing an increase in accidents. Phones cause distractions and could change the behavior of the driver. Because of cell phones being used while driving there have been about 390,000 injuries each year. Therefore, we should ban drivers from being able to use their cell phones.",0
"Venus is called the ""Evening Star"" and it's one of the brightest points of lights in the night sky. Venus is the second planet from the sun. It has been often refered to as earth's twin. It's been over three decades since a spacecraft has touched down on Venus. The carbon dioxide level is at 97 percent, and their are clouds of highly corrsive sulfuric acid and the average temerature is 800 degrees in fehrenheit, and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater than our planets. This environment would crush a submarine even when its accustomed to diving in the deepest parts of our oceans. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system even though Mercury is closer to the sun. And the weather presents errupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on it surface. Venus once was the most Earth-like planet in our solar sytem that could have supported various forms of life like Earth. NASA has a possible solution to allow humans to study Venus, they will have to where we could hover 30 miles above the landscape so it'd be at sea level and the temerture would be at 170 degrees fehreheit, it won't be easy conditions but they are survivable for humans. They will be limited from what they can see and get. Others are trying for a more simplified approach by making electronics out of silicon carbide, which can last 3 weeks in Venus's conditions. Another one is Mechanical Computers which goes back as far as the 1800s and then played an important role in the 1940's during World War II. They made calculations by using gears and levers and did not require electronics at all. Modern computers are powerful. flexible, and quick but they are more delicate while a system made out of mechanical parts can be made to be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.",0
"Have you ever heard of the ""Unmasking the face on Mars"" before? Well people started making accusations before they got a high quality photograph. They though it was a face aliens had made on Mars, that was one of the many accusation made about the face on Mars.

The face on Mars is just a landmark because ""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 98a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" So there as a big cloudy winter storm when people discovered the face. Well with all the wind blowing it could of just been made of dirt and rocks and everything blowed into one pile and by a cowincidence been made into a face.

Second another reason why the face is just a landmark because right after the winter storm they got ""A 1976 Viking 1 photograph of the Face on Mars."" Before they can go make accusations that go into history you have to have a high quaity picture to prove you are right. They got one picture and that is not enough to solve something in history to start making illogical accusations without evidence.

Finally why the face is just a landmark on mars is because instead of waiting to get a high quality image they waited 3 years to go back to Mars to see it. When they finally did go back to see the face they had a lot better and high quality cameras. So when they arrived back on Mars it was proven that the so called face was just a landmark. A quote in the text that makes everything logical is ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West.""

So there you have it the face on Mars was just a landmark not an alien face.

See before everyone made illogical accusations they did not have a high quality photo and when they first took the photo when it was a cloudy day. NASA is correct because before making accusation they went and got evidence to prove their thoery's.",0
"I feel like we should change the votes and make it into a popular vote for the president of the United States. In a electoral vote is most worrying of a tie. Its also unfair to most people. Also electoral college systems voters don't vote for the president. People always get confused with the voting which makes electoral voting a struggle.

One of the main reasons is that people worry about electoral votes ending in a tie. In the article it states that if it does end in a tie, then the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives. This is where state delegations vote on the president. Also the Senate would choose the vice-president.

Another reason, it is unfair to most people. Now it all counts as to one vote for the whole state. If most people vote for the president the like its only going to get one vote for the state. In the article it states that this type of vote the currently have is a ""winner takes all' vote. Which in the thoughts of most people is unreasonable and also unfair.

Also, in the electoral college system, people don't vote for the president. A very few of it elects the president. The problem with this is who are the electors, who picks them and it states that it can be anyone that is not holding the office. So most of the voters get confused about the electors and they may vote the wrong candidate.

In conclusion, those are the reason why the electoral system are wrong. It's unfair to most people, it might end in a tie and the voting is confusing. This should be a contest of who gets more votes, not by the states vote.",0
"Although Venus has a reputation for being difficult to study, scientists have tried numerous times with unmaned spacecrafts. Each time, however, the spacecraft has not survived on Venus for more than a few hours. The author of the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" suggests that Venus is a worthy puruit despite its many dangers. The author does this by describing the planet's similarities to Earth, Venus's location in the solar system, and by describing the vast differences between Earth and Venus.

Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin due to its many similarites. Both planets have similar sizes and distances from the sun. Scientists also believe that Venus was once a hospitible planet due to its similarities to Earth. Scientists have discovered that Venus has some features that are similar to those on Earth, such as land formations. Even though Venus is so hospitable, it is the closest planet to Earth and is the quickest travel throughout space. If Venus were to once again become hospitible as it was before, humans could potentially travel there.

Venus has a similar distance from the sun as Earth, meaning that it should be similarly hospitible. However, Venus has high temperatures and pressure which does not add up to the distance from the sun. The temperature on a planet is determined by the planet's distance from the sun and how much heat and light is able to travel to the planet. Since Earth is hospitible at a similar distance as Venus, then why is Venus plagued by severe temperatures? This and other mysteries about Venus are being questioned by scientists, but without the ability to get close to the planet, most exploration is impossible due to the thick atmosphere.

Although Earth and Venus have many similarities, their living conditions vastly differ. Due to Venus's acidic atmosphere and severe heat, living on Venus is impossible, while Earth is currently populated by a variety of creatures. Venus has temperatures that average over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit, while the pressue is about ninety times greater than that on Earth. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any of the other planets, even hotter than Mercury. Venus is also plagued by volcanos, earthquakes, and frequent lightning. These differences may seem confusing because Mercury is closer to the sun and should, in theory, be the hottest planet in the solar system. Venus should also have a surface temperature and pressure similar to that of Earth.

If scientists were able to figure out more information about Venus, it may provide more information about the solar system and about Earth. Since evidence suggests that Venus was once more similar to Earth, studying the planet may provide insight as to why Venus was turned into such an inhospitable planet, and if it could happen to Earth. Scientists could also potentially develop a way to live on Venus or turn its living conditions back to how it once was in the past. In conclusion, the author uses this evidence to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its many dangers.",0
"There is no right or wrong answer to this question, as it depends on the individual's preferences and goals. However, I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.

One reason why it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that it prepares students for future careers. For example, a student who specializes in history may find that they are limited in their career options, since many jobs do not require historical knowledge. However, a student who has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more likely to find a job that matches their skills and interests.

Another reason why it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that it allows students to explore different fields of study. For example, a student who specializes in math may find that they are not interested in other subjects, such as English or history. However, a student who has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more likely to find a subject that they are interested in and want to continue studying.

Finally, I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it makes students more well-rounded. For example, a student who specializes in math may find that they are not very good at writing essays. However, a student who has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will be able to write essays, do math problems, and communicate effectively, all of which are important skills for future careers.

"So, you have read the article Unmasking the Face on Mars, am i right? Well, I have some theories of my own, and I can assure you that Cydonia on mars, is not a face or anything extra-terrestrial.

My first reason as to why Cydonia on mars isnt a face is, well have you ever looked at the moon? Ever notice that when the moon if full, you see a face? Scientists in the past have been to the moon on investigations. While they were there they have proven that the face on the moon was just a bunch of craters. It is most likely that the face on mars is just creaters, or a mesa too.

My second reason is, things in outer space pictures are going to be a lot bigger than in reality. Take the sun for an example, we see the sun ten times smaller than it really is. If the sun was just as small as we presume it is, then how would planets, that are thousands of light years away, possibly get warm?

The final picture they took on April 5,1998, actually showed the Martain equivalent of a buttle or mesa. Buttles and mesas are landforms common around the American west. ""It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same hieght as the Face on Mars."" The Snake River in Idaho is basically evidence that Cydonia isnt really a face and that is was just a buttle, or mesa.

My third and final reason is, that all planets start off as a big ball of rock, meteors, and astroids that collide with each other. The possiblities of a ball of rock, a planet, having left over craters from all of the collisions, is very high. If, somewhere way far out in space, or even just one planet away, wouldn't we have had a lot more pictures, videos, and newspaper articles about aliens?

This is only three theories backed with evidence, and I'm sure that if you talk to any other of these wonderful scientists at NASA, that they can also provide more reasons with more evidence. Thus, I really hope that these reasons help you clearify that Cydonia is not a sign of Extra-Terrestrial activity.",0
