"Have you ever met someone, or an interviewer, and show a good or bad impression to them? People think that first impression can be changed because everybody has a second chance. While others think that first impression can not be changed because it shows who you are. I agree to the motion that first impression are impossible to change because it shows your personality, your attitude and who you are.

Firstly, first impressions are impossible to change because it shows your personality. I had a friend, who dressed inappopriartely to an interview for her job. But to her surprise she did not get the job because of how she dressed. Also after a while, she couldn't get any job elsewhere. This means that whenever you go somewhere, you should dress appropriately, check how you use your tone with others, so people will know that you are a good person, respectful, can take responsibiliy for your actions and shows how mature you are. Not only does first impressions show your personality, however, it shows your attitude.

Additionally, showing your attitude is most likely impossible to change. I remember I used to disrespect, fight and insult others when they did something to me I didn't like or even if they needed help from me. I met this old lady and she asked for my help then I told her that I didn't want to and insulted her, then she said to me I am going to have a hard time in life but i didn't take what sh said seriouly and left. As a result of what happened, as I grew up, I tried to change but couldn't because when something goes bad and I knew it was not me, they will all mention my name. And I wish there was someone there to offend me. And thats when I remembered what the old lady told me, I wanted to go ask for forgiveness but unlucky for me she went to heaven and now am left with her curse. Which gives me this conclusion that always respect everyone you see even if you don't know them.

First impressions also shows the kind of person you really are.

Furthermore, your impressions shows who you are. Not long ago, this was this lady on the news. When i heard the news it shocked me because she went to a store, picked an ice cream from the fridge, licked it, and put it back in the fridge without paying for it. This obviously shows that, she ruined her reputation in public and everywhere. Now everyone knows who she really is. Not only did it ruined reputation but she brought a shame to herself, her family, and also her native country. First impressions are impossible to change.

Lastly, it is valid that first impressions can be changed because everyone has a second chance. But not really because sometimes your impressions towards someone stays the same even if you change. Others will think you are not your self today and also others will think it's a good thing but not everyone depending on what impression you made on your first time meeting. So I say that first impressions likely impossible to change.

In a Nutshell, showing your character, who you are, and your behaviour are impossible to change on your first impression. Mostly first impressions are not easy to change. Would you on your first impression be respectful or disrespectful, appopriate or inoppopriate, and be willing to take responsiblity of the concequences of you on seeing someone older than you, are you?",0
"The challenge of pursuiting and exploring Venus presents dangers lets start off by saying. Sulfruic acid in Venus's atmosphere tempetures are average of 800 degrees fahrenheit atomspheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we have on our own planet. Conditions are exterme to encounter what we have on our Earth this enviorment would crush even a submarine accustomed to dividing to the deepest parts of our ocean and would liquifey many metals. Beyond huge pressure the plant weather is beyond, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequently lightning strikes. To probes seeking land itsurface is much more dangerous for the a worthy pursuit depite the other dangers going on there on venus. Although Venusa had large oceans and could have upported various of forms of life. Venous also has some feature that are dangerous to those on earth. this is a crucial condisdersation.

Although scientist have created a "" float fray"" that is a blimp-like figure that can hover over 30 or so miles above Venusian's landscape the storms are still likely to hit. It is not a easy condition to send humans and have them survive. This hovering expirence is less effective more importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from that distance. Despite their risks or maybe even challenges having to face. Venus has lasted for three weeks in such conditions.

In conclusion, makinig more mechanical parts be made resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces could still be even better. But also there is always a risk to something. Striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus had value all because humans have a curiosity that will likely be gaining on the planet itself, our challenges should not be limited by dangers and doubts. We should be on the very edge and have imagination and creativity. These are the dangers of the study that Venus presents and a worthy pursuit depite danger it is a risky attempt for NASA and scientist.",0
"The Benefits of Volunteering at Local Animal Shelters Every day, thousands of homeless animals are abandoned and left to fend for themselves. Many end up in local animal shelters, where they are provided with food and shelter while they wait for a loving home. Fortunately, there are people who volunteer their time and energy to help these animals find homes. Volunteering at a local animal shelter is an incredibly rewarding experience that can bring joy not only to the lives of animals but also to those who volunteer as well. Volunteers play an important role in helping keep animal shelters running smoothly and efficiently by providing much-needed care for the animals. This includes basic tasks such as walking dogs or cleaning out cages, but volunteers also provide valuable companionship by spending quality time with them, cuddling and playing together. This kind of interaction helps socialize the pets so they will be better prepared when adopted into new homes. Additionally, volunteers often take on administrative duties like answering phones or entering data into computers which helps streamline operations within the shelter itself. Helping homeless animals in need is one way that volunteering brings great joy not just to our furry friends but also to those doing the work as well! Seeing sickly cats turned into healthy purring lap buddies and timid puppies transformed into energetic pals provides fulfillment beyond words! Working with wonderful staff members makes it even more enjoyable; volunteers often become part of an extended family made up co-workers focused on making sure every pet finds its forever home!. Besides helping others feel loved, being part of a team fosters cooperation between humans which ultimately lends itself towards creating long lasting friendships outside the workplace too!. Last but certainly not least, volunteering can teach us invaluable lessons about life - compassion for all living creatures no matter how small or vulnerable teaches us empathy which serves us well throughout our own lives - whether we’re dealing with unruly teenagers or difficult bosses at work –compassion always prevails!

"The consequences of a failure to educate are expensive in both financial and human terms. In financial terms, a lack of education can lead to increased unemployment, poverty, and inequality. In human terms, a lack of education can prevent people from finding and maintaining employment, earning a living, and accessing basic services.

Some of the most damaging consequences of a lack of education are economic. In an increasingly globalized world, a lack of education can lead to a disadvantage in the job market. In addition, a lack of education can impede people’s ability to find and keep a job, which can lead to increased poverty and inequality.

In addition to economic consequences, a lack of education can have a wide range of other negative consequences. These consequences can include reduced access to basic services, reduced opportunity, and increased social isolation.

A lack of education can have a significant impact on individuals and communities alike. In general, a lack of education leads to reduced access to social and economic opportunities. This can lead to increased social isolation and a decrease in the quality of life for individuals and communities.

In conclusion, a lack of education has a wide range of negative consequences, both economic and social. These consequences are often both costly and destructive. As a result, it is important to invest in education in order to ensure that all individuals and communities have the opportunity to improve their lives.

Enacting a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew is a controversial way to curb crime and promote healthy lifestyles among teenagers. On one hand, this measure could help reduce the number of late-night incidents involving teenagers, promoting their safety and citizens’ security. On the other hand, it could also restrict their freedom and limit recreational activities.   

For teenagers, a curfew could be beneficial in keeping them out of potentially dangerous situations and limiting exposure to dangerous elements in the streets at night. Parents would also benefit from a curfew, as it can reduce anxiety about their children’s safety and reaffirm their trust in the community’s ability to protect its members. However, teenagers may feel resentful if their freedom is restricted and feel deprived of opportunities for extracurricular activities and late-night socializing. 

Overall, a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew can be a useful tool for protecting teenagers and reducing crime. Nevertheless, it is important to consider the potential consequences of this measure on teenagers and parents, and look for creative ways to ensure a balance between safety and enjoyment.",1
"Mental health in university students has become an increasingly important topic of discussion in recent years. While academic success is a priority for many, it is essential to recognize the importance of maintaining good mental health during college. Students face innumerable challenges that can contribute to mental distress such as financial difficulties, the need to balance work and studies, personal relationships issues, and struggles with adapting away from home. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has only added further strain on student’s mental wellbeing due to additional changes in lifestyle brought about by social distancing measures or alternative forms of learning. It is vital that university students take proactive steps towards preserving their wellbeing while they are studying; this could include joining counselling services offered at universities or seeking online therapy options where available. Moreover, building supportive networks with peers can be beneficial both mentally and academically; talking through any worries or stressors alongside others who understand what you are going through can help alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation which often accompany struggling with one's mental health. Furthermore, making time for activities enjoyed outside of academics should be a priority; whether this may be exercising regularly (a known mood lifter) reading books for pleasure or simply finding some time each day for self reflection – these activities act as essential tools for improving overall quality of life whilst also providing respite from work stresses that come along with higher education pursuits. In conclusion it is imperative that we prioritize our mental health whilst attending university: allowing ourselves adequate time without feeling guilty about stepping back from our commitments every now and then will make us much better equipped to handle the various pressures associated with academia while also encouraging healthier habits all round - fostering improved resilience when faced by future obstacles both within study and beyond!

"People search for different opinions when trying to make a dission that could help benefit the person. One reason people seek multiple opinions is because they want to go with the majority of the people. Another reason is that people want to base their choice on the others opinions instead of just go with the flow. Seeking multiple opinions is a great way of making tough disisons.

People ask multiple people for opinions and go with the majority. One reason is, they usually don't have much time or have better things to do. A second reason is, the person trusts the people to give honest opinions about the subject. Third the person doesn't care to bring unnecessary attention to them self if the choice somehow brings it.

People want to base their choice on the others opinions instead of just go with the flow. The first reason is, people have the time to carefully examine the answers given to them to make their choice.

And finally, the person does care if the choice brings unnecessary attention that they don't want.

People seek multiple opinions for many reasons. The ones I mentioned where ones I find important to most people.",0
"Bycicles. Walking. Public buses. All three are alternatives to driving a car to arrive at places that you need to go. Some believe that having an automobile is essential to everyday life. Others may say that cars are unnecessary and a pollutants in our society. There are many advantages of limited car usage.

Limiting the use of cars could help reduce the amount of pollutantss in our environment. In Source two, it states, ""Cold nights and warm air caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emission."" This tells us that car emissions are being caught in the air due to the weather, causing a layer of smog to settle over congested cities. By limiting the use of automobiles, the layer of smog was able to vanish, but if we were able to limit cars permanently, then we would not have to worry about it in the first place. In Source four, it tells us that, ""If the pattern persists... it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" This proves that car emissions are harmful to the environment and that future generations are at risk because of the pollution already in the air. Also, the statement shows that Americans are very dependant on transportation, but are unwilling to try a different method such as walking and biking. By reducing the number of cars on the road, our environment would be helped tremendously.

Having to worry about driving a car may produce more stress in a persons life. In Source three, it says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" This tells us that riding in an automobile, while the roads are very crowded, causes people to worry about whether or not they are going to be in an accident. Also, it has been proven that exercise helps to lower stress, and by riding a bike instead of driving a car, stress may be lowered by simply using your resources to get where you need to go. In Source one, it tells us, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier now. Heidrun Walter, mother of two."" This proves that people are worried about their car and if it might break down, or something worse. Something can always go wrong with a car, whether it be trouble with the engine or you accidently locked your keys inside, and it becomes very expensive when you have to fix a small blunder. By limiting car ownership, less people have to worry about their automobile.

A great alternative to owning a car is public transportation. In Source four it explains, ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends."" By uses others means of transportation, it makes it very convenient for kids to meet up with their friends for a while, and still get to where they need to go. Also, public transportation is much cheaper than buying a car and gas for it, and it helps reduce the number of cars on the road. In Source two, it tells us that ""Public transit was free of charge for Friday to Monday."" By taking the bus that the government provided people received free transportation, allowing them to not have to worry about parking, gas prices, or potential accidents. They could travel wherever they needed to go on a very convinient mode of transportation for no cost to them. Public transportation, or carpooling, is an amazing way to lower the number of cars on the road, while still providing people with a way to be driven to the destination they need to get to.

Automobiles, the plugs to the sinks of the streets of the world, seem to clog up the efficient system of transportion. Parents, workers, and athletic kids alike are affected by the large number of cars on the road. By reducing the number of cars on the road, there would be a direct impact on our environment, emotions, and future generations.",0
"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for society and the environment. One of the main benefits is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to a report from the New York Times, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and combat climate change.

Another advantage of reducing car usage is the improvement in air quality. In the case of Paris, for example, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog. The ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and helped reduce the pollution levels in the city (Duffer). Similarly, in Bogota, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The event was successful in reducing traffic jams and encouraging citizens to use public transportation, walk, or bike (Selsky).

Limiting car usage can also make urban areas more compact and accessible. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents have given up their cars and instead rely on bicycles, public transportation, and walking. This has led to a more vibrant community with stores and amenities within walking distance (Rosenthal). By adopting this approach in more suburban areas, we can reduce urban sprawl and create neighborhoods that are less dependent on cars.

Additionally, reducing car usage can have positive health impacts. Research shows that people who walk, bike, or use public transportation as their primary mode of transportation have better overall health and are less likely to suffer from obesity and heart disease (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage, we can encourage more physical activity and improve the well-being of individuals.

While there may be concerns about the impact on the car industry, it is important to adapt to changing behaviors and prioritize the environment and public health. Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle (Rosenthal). This shift in focus can lead to the development of alternative modes of transportation that are more sustainable and less reliant on individual car ownership.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring about several advantages for society and the environment. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating more compact and accessible communities, the benefits of reducing car usage are significant. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and prioritizing the environment and public health, we can work towards a more sustainable future.",1
"Thomas Jefferson wrote Determine never to be idle.. it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. I agree that we accomplish more if we are always doing something right or important, however, that it doesnt mean that you are idle. While, if we are working or study.

They are many people that works on importants jobs, sometime they suggest you to have a lot of energy and be preparated. For example at the job alot of employees that against you because they said that you are idle, and you dont want to do nothing. Insted that the employees at your job dont know that you are tired because you have two jobs.

Some people, students or parents lived so tire and they look idle. At my house we live all togethers and sometime i dont to do nothing at my house. My parents argument me that i dont clean the house. For example that i dont study or help my mom with my little brother. In addition my family doesnt know that i have tow jobs because i want to help her to play the rent of the house, that why some people lookd idle or tired.

They are some friends that they teach you and they support you to be a better person with good behaviour those people want you to be how great you are doing something productive. Neverles, some friends want you to be like them with bad reputation. For example unemplayment, without money, you need to be reponsibility of your acts.

In conclusion, it doesnt matter if other people are telling you idle or unemplayment, they are time that it is hard to find a job or you just want to rest because you are tire, it is wonderful to know that how much may be done if are always doing something;Therefore, some people think that does inactivity also serve a purpose. In my opinion they should be doing somthing at life to receive a good pupose in your life.                            ",0
"land of the free, the brave, and millions of proud citizens who live in a country that prides itself on its preservation of human rights and everything else that makes up a proper society. However, in order to remain a fair republic that truly takes into account the opinions of all citizens, we must make one major change. The flawed Electoral College must be abolished and replaced with election by popular vote in order to ensure the well being of our country.

Proponents of the Electoral College would gasp in horror at this suggestion, arguing that their systematic method is virtually foolproof. Nevertheless, with a voting method as complicated as the Electoral College, the room for error is far too great. Just look at what happened in 1960, when racist legislators tried to replace the democratic electors chosen by popular vote in order to sabotage John F. Kennedy's chances. Then yet another electoral disaster occurred in 2000. Both of these events could very easily happen again and the consequences of such mistakes are unfathomable. History has been proven to repeat itself, and this is no exception. Who's to say that electors won't just ignore the wishes of voters or that legislators won't manipulate the system? When it comes to choosing our leader, whose actions will ultimately decide whether or not America will continue to survive and thrive, it would be a huge mistake to leave this responsibility to one group of individuals. After all, nobody is perfect.

Furthermore, advocates of the Electoral College make a major fallacy when they claim that voters in swing states are more informed on election information, therefore it's good that the electoral system causes candidates to only focus on them. Just consider the fact that by completely ignoring all of the other states, campaigners are ignoring millions of individuals who deserve to have a say in who will be in charge. Through this one argument, advocates are essentially assuming anyone who doesn't live in a swing state doesn't care about the election as much and therefore they shouldn't have a say in the matter. This is simply not true. In fact, these advocates fail to acknowledge that if voters in other states are not as educated or interested, it is a consequence of the Electoral College. While politicians are focusing all of their time and effort on the thoughtful voters, other citizens don't get the information they need from seeing campaigns and meeting candidates. They are deprived of the opportunity to make an educated decision like swing voters and that is a fault of the college, not the voters themselves.

The problems with the Electoral College only go on. If a tie were to occur, the election would be determined by members of the House of Representatives, who do an even poorer job of representing the people considering each state casts only one vote. Also, due to the fact that the Electoral College mainly operates with the winnertakeall rule, it is easy for individuals in Democratic or Republican states to feel as if their vote doesn't matter.

It is also important to note that at the end of the day, election by popular vote accomplishes the goal of reflecting the opinion of the public far better than election by Electoral College. The popular vote is a clear statement of voters' opinions and is virtually unable to be tampered with. On the other hand, the Electoral College only complicates the situation by introducing a middle man who is prone to bribery and mistakes. Why should we allow candidates to win because of the electoral vote if they do not recieve the overall approval of the public? Compare the opinions of 538 electors to the opinions of hundreds of millions of voters. Evidently, the opinions of all these voters cannot be properly represented by these 538 electors. It's just impossible both logistically and logically.

For all of these reasons, I urge you to change the system to election by popular vote. It is without a doubt the only way this country can continue to be the great nation that it is for centuries to come.",0
"Some schools thinks that students should attend classes at home. Others might think that attending classes at school will give benefits to the students. Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more subjects than online classes. If students does not attend classes at school there would not be teachers and staffs at the school.

Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more of other subjects. If a student takes classes at home they would not be focusing on their assignment. They going to be on their phone, TV, or other type of devices. There will be no one supervising the students at home. They need teachers to teach them, educate them, and motivate them to learn. Attending classes at school as you can see will benefit the student..

In addition, If the students does not attend classes at school there would not be no teachers and staffs at the school. Many jobs will be lost due to students taking classes online. Plus, the students needs to build a relationship with the teacher and staffs. Online classes would not teach a student face to face, It would be better If a teacher teaches the student face to face. As a result, there should be teachers and staff at the school, If the student takes classes at the school. Plus, the students will get a better education.

Many people may argue that students should take classes online instead of going to school. People think that online classes will give the student benefits. They also think that the benefit of taking online classes, is to give the students more opportunity to learn. In the other hand, they are people who also believe that taking classes in school is better. Schools are meant for students to learn on other subjects. If a student takes classes in school they will have the opportunity to learn much better.

Therefore, students should take classes in school. Schools are meant to be for students to learn from all subjects. Taking classes in school would benefit the students. If the students take classes in school, there will be more teachers and staff at the school. Truly, learning from a teacher helps you a lot, because they are teaching you face to face.",0
"There are a few key things to remember when considering this question. First, children are not born knowing how to cooperate or compete; these are skills that must be learned. Second, both cooperation and competition can be beneficial to children; it depends on the context in which they are used. Finally, it is possible for children to learn both cooperation and competition; they are not mutually exclusive.

With that said, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate. Cooperation is essential for many aspects of life, from working on a team to simply getting along with others. It is a skill that can be used in any situation, and it is one that will serve children well as they grow up.

There are a few reasons why I believe cooperation is so important for children. First, it teaches them to be considerate of others. When children cooperate, they have to think about the needs of others and how their actions will affect them. This is an important lesson to learn, as it will help them to be more thoughtful and considerate people as they grow up.

Second, cooperation teaches children to compromise. This is another essential life skill, as it is often necessary to compromise in order to get along with others. When children learn to compromise, they learn to see things from another person’s perspective and to find common ground. This is a skill that will be useful in all kinds of relationships, both personal and professional.

Finally, cooperation helps children to build relationships. When children cooperate, they have to communicate and work together. This can help them to build strong relationships with others, as they learn to trust and rely on each other. These are important skills to have, both in childhood and adulthood.

Of course, competition can also be beneficial to children. It can teach them to set goals and to work hard to achieve them. It can also teach them to be resilient in the face of failure. However, I believe that cooperation is more important, as it is a skill that can be used in any situation and that will help children throughout their lives.

"Dear Mr./Mrs. senator

I beleive that you should consider voting against the electoral college. Now you may ask why, but, I assure you that the electoral college is a way for corrupt presidential candidates to win the office and make this great nation a horrible place. To back up my reasoning here are 3 reasons as to why you should consider voting against the electoral college. Segregationists replacing voters of one canidate for another, the election could become a catastrophe if a tie were to happen, there is a chance of a ""disaster factor"" happening.

In 1960 segregationists in Louisiana nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose J.F.K. (Source 2, Bradford Plumer, The indefensible electoral college: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, P. 11, line 44) Imagine if the corrupters had been able to corrupt the election, we might have had a fiasco bigger than the 2000 presidential fiasco. If we were to continue to turn our backs on the matter we would soon be run by fatasses who spent all their time gaming and would claim they know exactly how the sytem works, opposed to a real man who spent all his time rising from the bottom up and knows the system by heart. Who do you think would win if those 2 people were to run for President? Not the one who should.

Some people claim an electoral tie is impossible, but, in 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election, if that doesn't seem so bad lets take a look  at how many people are in the United States alone. In 1976 a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 from Hawaii had voted the other way. (Plumer, P. 12, line 80) The election is really only a few swing voters away from catastrophe, and possibly, the worst government shutdown these United States have ever seen. So, if 41,971 voters from 1968 didn't seem like alot, then lets look at the 9,246 voters from 1976, ties are seemingly getting closer and closer, what will happen when it is too late?

There is  always the off chance of a ""disaster factor"" occuring, like the one in the 2000 Al Gore VS. Bush Presidential election. Imagine if that were to happen again, only, this time, we put a blood thirsty, war hungry, nuclear savage into office. Imagine the Iraq and Afghanistan wars from 2000-present and then imagine them being fought on our own soil, imagine, instead of little Iragi children fighting against an invading force, your children fighting against an invading force, and that is just one of the minor things that could happen. Imagine if we put a man in office who thought the way to answer everything was through nuclear war, imagine what would happen to the United States. These are just a few examples of what could happen if another ""disaster factor"" were to happen again.

These are the 3 reasons as to why i beleive you should consider voting against using the electoral college. Imagine if We the People actually got to vote OUR favorite president into office on OUR own terms instead of some idiots a political party throws together, imagine how much better off we would be than we are now.",0
"Many people wonder whether or not cars should be ban to help save the environment. They dont know if that would help us or make matters worse. Their are many advantages to not using cars. Some people just can't seem to let go of their cars. They need a push to get started and to stop using their cars every single day.

Their are multiple advantages to the banning of cars. One example would be getting rid of air pollution. Most air pollution is caused by cars so if you get rid of cars you will also get rid of air pollution. Air pollution can cause a lot of different problems it can cause people to get sick or many other things, so getting rid of it completely could help a lot of people.

Another thing people wouldn't have to worry about would be traffic jams on the way to work. During the week some many people are trying to get to and from work at the same time it causes a traffic jam. People are often late to work because of this reason. So putting a ban on cars could help out with that. People could walk to and from work or ride a bike. This would limit the number of traffic jams and people wouldn't have to worry about being late to work.

If people walked everywhere instead of drove everywhere people would be getting a lot of exercise and that could help too. Cars make us seem lazy where we drive everywhere we want to go but if we walk or rode a bike that could help out in many ways. Walking could get things off your mind you could walk with a friend that way you can hangout and talk about things while you walk. Walking could relieve stress. It could calm you down and just make you relax for a few and forget about all your problems.

Putting a ban on cars could also help the town in which you live in, not only by limiting air pollution but it could boost town activity. New restaurants would be built, and more places to shop. People would spend money on other things besides gas for their cars. Town businesses would do better and make more money, also new businesses could form.

Also getting rid of cars could limit the amount of deaths every year. Many deaths every year come from car accidents, drunk drivers, people not paying attention and many other things. If everyone walked or rode bikes to the places they wanted to go that could get rid of many deaths that happen every single day. That would make the world safer in so many ways.

Getting rid of cars and not depending on cars for everything could be what this worlds needs to improve itself. This could take us one step closer to living longer, happier, and healthy lives. People wouldn't have to worry about getting a car or paying insurance on a car. People wouldn't have to worry about getting their kids license, teaching them how to drive or anything like that. The number of deaths each year could go down and things could change for the better.",0
"The author evaluated their ideas about visiting Venus well in their essay, however, they did have some aspects that could be improved upon. Their introduction lacked a strong thesis which can have a negative impact on the rest of the essay if their claims aren't strongly proven. Despite their weak thesis, their claims made later in the essay were strongly proven. Not only did the author give basic background knowledge of venus and two main reasons as to why studying venus could benefit the human race, but they also gave a solution to the dangers that came with exploring the planets..

In the introduction paragraph, the author didn't give a strong thesis to state their clame. When making a thesis you want to include what claims you will be covering in the essay and what you are trying to prove. The only claim the author gave was in the last sentence of the paragraph where they stated,"" It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."" They didn't give specifics as to what claims they will make to prove that Venus should be examined and their vocabulary seemed limited when they used the word ""very.""

Throughout the second and third paragraphs of the essay, the writer gave background knowledge of Venus compared to Earth. This was a good decision because they later used some of the facts that were stated to strengthen their reasoning as to why Venus should be visited and examined. They stated how hard it was to examine Venus and how dangerous the planet was for life. The planet would not be able to sustain human life due to it's harsh terrain and harsh weather. One of the reasons scientists are studying Venus is because they believed that Venus looked like what modern-day Earth does at one point. The writer bringing up how unhabitable Venus is strengthens their argument on why we need to study Venus and their belief that because this happened to Venus, then it could potentially happen to Earth.

Writing about how Venus used to be like Earth and why that's important is a strong point to support the writers claim. When writing a persuasive or argumentative essay, including how what the author is writing about can benefit the reader is a way to persuade the reader to agree with the author. In the essay, the writer talks about two different ways that learning about Venus can benefit the human race. The first reason has to do with benefiting the way that humans are able to survive on Earth. Finding out what changed Venus to become inhabitable can stop the potential for the same to happen to Earth. The next reason they argued, in paragraph 4, was that if something happens to Earth, Venus is in close proximity. One day, the Earth's surface may become dangerous for human life and humans must flee to the nearest planet to survive. The author believes that finding out the exact conditions of Venus and finding a way to sustain human life on the planet would greatly benefit the human races future.

Lastly, the writer gives a solution to the most important problem stated in the essay, that it would be difficult for humans to live on Venus or even visit it. Throughout the fifth and sixth paragraph, the author talks about how research has already been done to find ways for humans to live on Earth. They even provide ideas of the their own for how humans can live on Venus. Pointing out problems with your ideas but then solving them is a strong way to argue your point because it eliminates the question of ""will it fail?"" and might answer some questions that readers have when reading the essay.

Overall, the author argues their points well. The structure of their essay has some aspects that can and should be changed, such as the introduction paragraph. The author showed why their claim was important to the reader and answered the ""how will it be done?"" part of their claim. Answering the ""how will it be done?"" part of the claim can eliminate doubt among the reader and strengthen the argument that the writer is trying to get across to the reader.",0
"The ""face"" is just a land form. You might ask why or maybe even how. Well one if NASA keeps saying that there is nothing there its just a face then yeah its just a land form shapped like a face. NASA would get a lot of money if they found some life form on a planet so they wouldnt keep it quiet. There are many land forms that look like that. So if the MGS on the planet kept looking it would find more land forms that looked like that. If it was an alien how is it still alive. All living things need water to survive. So wheres the water at? Also the people found beter cameras to use to take the picture. It was much clearer and you could tell it was just a land form. Michael Malin an his team messed up the first time because when they took the picture it was winter and very cloudy on the Red Planet. The camera lense had to look through shallow clouds to see the face. So some people said the alien face was hidden by haze. So Micheal Malin and his team tried again in April 8, 2001 to take another picture. It was perfect because it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The picture was clear perfect nothing could have told you that, that was an alien face. Some even said it looks like something here on earth. Either a pyramid in Egyptian time or maybe even a mountain. You can make up myths and say that its an alien face, but all the facts say that its just a land form. The land form that looks like a face. It is the ""face"" that helped NASA look closer at there pictures and work on there camera work. The ""face"" has helped people learn more about the night sky and the planets and even the world. But the ""face"" is just a land form.",0
"Dear senator,

MONTH_DAY_YEAR

I am writing this letter to you today to let you know I stroungly believe that we should demolish the process of electoral college. Why you may ask? First, it is unfair, we are the votes they not. Second, it is outdated (

""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer

) Lastly,

First, it is not fair. We the people are surposed to chose the president not some privite party that we never meet. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer ;according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- wor the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to kind we have now."" So we vote yes but he doesn't become president; do we even matter? It doesn't seem like it.

Second of all, it is very outdated. According to ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by The Office of the Federal Register this process was founded in the days of the four founding fathers. That's old! Now in days we have found better and fair ways to do pretty much every thing.

I hope this letter helps you decide on weather or not we should keep the process of electoral college.

"Dear Mr. Principal today I want to talk abot how most employees are looking for a specific characteristics in potential employee even if they don't know the job. I agree with this prompt because a person not always know how to do a job, but they can learn.

Some people when they are new on a job they don't really know what to do, they have to be trainig for another person that alredy know the job like a manager, maybe employees are looking for a manager, the person they contract to be the manager maybe her/ him don't have the experience at all, but they can learn over the time they are working. For example when I came to this country I start to work with my stepfahter to put ruffin, I didn't know how to do the job, bit I learn over the time that I work with him. Last summer I was working on a restaurant like a cashier and I had a problem because I didn't know the differences on the coins because in my country it was really different, but I learn a lot because the manager from the restaurant help me to be succesful on the job, and I put a lot of eargerness to leanr the job.

A lot of people when they know the job they like to work hard becuase they want to learn more about it, some people that alreayd know the job they can learn new things about the job from another employee or manager. A lot of people here in United States work hard for the benefits of their family not just for a benefit to be hired, They know that if they work hard their childrens can leanr abot their experience, and they can be a better person, a lot of parents like to be a example for their childrens, so the way their childrens know that work hard is something that you need to be proud of. Some of them work hard to achieve their goals, or to have a better future.

However, be responsable is another important thing that you need to keep in mind, be responsable can help you to get hired on the job, if you are responsable the main boss are going to see that they need people that are responsable to be more succesful. A lot of companies grow up because their employee are responsable, and they complete all the activities their boss ask them to do. When I was in my country a lot of people tried to put like a store, but it never work because the people they put to work they didn't show up on time, and they weren't responsale on their activities, and the store had to close because they didn't improve what they want to do. Be responsable is one thing that is going to help you to be succesful in life becuase if you are new to a job and you show up on time they are going to see that you are really responsable with your activities and that's what most of the jobs are looking for people how are responsable.

Another thing that employers need to know that they have to contract a person that is going to have patient, in every job they have a manager and employers should know if the manager have the patient to be training people that is new on the jop. Lets do a example some managers are impatient they don't like to help people that don't know the job because they said that they don't have the time to be training people because they think that the person is never going to learn how to do the job, or they have another important activitie to do instead of be training a new person. In a lot of restaurants or stores the managers are always with good actitude and they like to help people.

In my conclusion I would say that a employee don't have to know how to do a job if they are responsable and they like the job him/her are going to learn what they need to do to be succesful on the job. Another thing is that you don't born with experiences you need to learn from the callenges life give to you and you can learn from your mistakes.",0
"Senator,

The Electoral Eollege seems highly unfair to the people. The winner, may not even be the majority vote. Perhaps a president received a majority of the votes, but the people then have to rely on electors to vote for them. That vote may not be what the people really wanted.

When it is time for elections, small states have a disadvantage on having a big part in the president's election. A president may win over five smaller states, and yet the other could win over California and still have more electoral votes. Larger states get more attention than smaller states. This is unfair. Some voters feel trapped because they know their vote won't effect the state ruling. Voters lose incentive.

Voters in presidential elections tend to want to be heard and feel as if their vote matters so they can express their political preferences. With electoral college votes, they feel the vote is unfair and they are relying on a few people and hoping they vote for the voters candidate. The people feel as if it's kind of like gmabling. In swing states, people have an advantage there. The ""winner-take-all"" method induces the candidates to pay more attention to those states. The candidates will campaign there more often and gain more and more attention from the swing state voters. Other states do not like this because they get less attention and the votes in swing states are more thoughtful than one-sided states.

The Electoral College votes, seem not-so-democtratic. It is the electors who actually end up electing the president...not the people. Anyways, this",0
"From what I have experienced, it'seems as though the working world has become more stressful and less leisurely than it used to be. I believe this because I have seen examples of people working long hours and not being able to take a break, even for just a few minutes. In the past, people would usually take a break during their lunch hour or after work, so that they could go for a walk, read a book, or just relax. These days, it'seems as though such a break is not often given, which can lead to people feeling overwhelmed and stressed.

I also believe that the working world is becoming more competitive. In the past, people would usually work with other people in order to accomplish a common goal. Now, people are working alone in order to achieve a goal, which can lead to a lot of stress and competition. Finally, I believe that the working world is becoming more sedentary. People are now spending more time sitting than they used to, which can lead to problems such as weight gain and health problems.

"There are a few reasons why younger people may enjoy life more than older people. One reason is that younger people generally have more energy than older people. They can stay up later, party more, and be more active in general. Another reason is that younger people are generally more optimistic than older people. They tend to believe that anything is possible and that the future will be better than the present. Finally, younger people are generally less burdened by responsibilities than older people. They may not have a job, a family, or a mortgage to worry about.

Of course, there are exceptions to every rule. Some older people are very active and optimistic, and some younger people are burdened by responsibilities. But in general, I believe that younger people enjoy life more than older people do.

"The Electoral College is an outdated system of voting. There are few weak reasons why it should be carried out as the nations voting process. The United States of America should change to election by popular vote for the presidency.

Admmitedely, the winner take all system is a fair way of deciding the votes. In the first article ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, the author asserts, ""Most states have a winnertakeall system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate."" If a presidential candidate spends lot of time, effort, and money in a campaign for a ""swing"" state he should be awarded all the votes for winning that state. It is a high risk but high reward to spend all that time and money to only earn sixty percent of the votes. That is why a ""winnertakeall"" is crucial. To add on, the author of the first article mentions, ""Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are..."" This is saying that a candidate chooses his or her electors, and you vote for the electors to then choose the candidate you voted for. However the people should have the right to directly choose the candidate of his or her choice. Therefore, the electoral college is outdated and must be eliminated.

To start off, Bradford Plumer the author of ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" states, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Every vote counts. But why make a vote more powerful than another. Citizens shouldn't be given a special vote just because they were chosen by the candidates party. Additionally, Plumer explains, ""If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" Why should kerry earn 34 electoral votes. He should earn the amount of voters in that state he persuaded to vote for him. He should not earn the electoral votes of all the people that did not think he was the best presidential candidate. Every vote should count, and that is why the electoral college should be eliminated.

Secondly, Plumer claims ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The senate would choose the vicepresident. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represnt 35million voters."" This method is rediculous. A state with one representative should not have the equal amount of power as a state with 55. If popular vote is made the way of electing then the odds of a tie would be nearly impossible. Also Plumer adds, ""Al Gorethanks to the quirks of the electoral collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency."" This means more people thought he was better suited to be the President of the United States, but Bush won because of the ""quirks"" of the electoral college. All in all, the electoral college is unfair, and creates more problems then popular vote.

The United States of america should change from the electoral college to popular vote. The outcome would be better for the country, and fairer to the candidates. That is why the electoral college should be eliminated.",0
"Driving and Cell Phone Usage

Just say you were stopped at a red light. You were minding your own business listening to Luke Combs new album and BAM. Someone behind you was on their phone and they didn't realize that there was a red light. If he would have not picked up his cell phone your car wouldn't have been rear-ended, but instead your going to need a new bumper and you pray that he has insurance. Cell phone can be a very dangerous thing while blowing DUI accidents out of the park. Some say that drinking and driving is more dangerous but let these facts tell you otherwise.

Even though phones are said to be used during emergencies only driving down a two-lane road on snapchat is not an emergency. Texting and driving has 6 times the accident rate than drinking and driving. There is at least one death everyday due to cell phones, you could be next if your using your cell phone. That risk becomes 4 times greater just by picking your phone up. Another reason not to pick up your phone if you were to get in an accident and survive your insurance cost will drastically go up. It doesn't even have to be your phone just reaching for any object in your car increases your risk by 8.8%.

1/3 of all car crash fatalities are due to mobile phones, not just texting or changing a song, but any cell phone related activity. You can look down for 1 second, but people lack the necessary reaction time to be able to look up and react to a pedestrian or a car running a red light. One way to prevent all this tragedy is to use some kind of Bluetooth device where you are using your phone hands free and you can pay attention to the road and surroundings. Using headphones are any of the such are still illegal in multiple states including Georgia. 88% of American drivers will use their phone on a road trip. While using headphones in Georgia is illegal the use of a hands-free device is legal. If it does not involve your hands being used, then you are allowed to use them. For example, blue tooth devise is highly recommended.

We need ways to prevent the usage of a cellular device while out on the road a great way to do this is; to keep your phone out of reach. Put it in your trunk or even in a glove box so you are not tempted to grab it. Keep your phone on silent or shut your phone completely off so you will not be distracted by an incoming call or message. There are special apps you can download on your phone that will allow all incoming messages to be blocked and on hold until you reach a point to where you can answer, only is the car is stopped and put into park. Every one in five people text and drive. This is no doubt ably the reason the rick factor is so high.

So, when your out driving and your mom calls to see where you are or if your okay make sure your phone will not hinder you from driving. You need both hands and eyes to drive. If you don't pay attention and you encounter a pedestrian walking, you might not be able to get out of the way in time. Accidents do happen and they happen many times a day. While so many people disobey the law, you can be that person who obeys the law and save someone's life by paying attention to your surroundings. People are always crowded you never know when some guy playing on his phone could jump out in front of you.",0
"Do you belive in weird landforms?

I believe in them because they didn't just come from any where. Also there are many landforms on the planet Earth.

The face on Mars is a natural landform. This is a natural landform because in paragraph 2 it states ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh"".

If it was created by aliens then wouldn't they at least mark or show a sign that it's theirs? They did mark that it was theirs by making it a face. Then why does it look like a human face? It looks lik a human face because maybe thats how they saw the first human.

I believe in weird landforms because it would make since that they would get there from either destrution of something else or creation of another landform. But why doesn't NASA send a space rover to mars to scan the face and collect some samples from it?",0
"Facial Coding: Valuable or Not

There is a new emotion reader out there, called FACS, short for the Facial Action Coding System. This new application has a bunch of cool features and innovations that can have some pretty practical applications. However, this essay is only focused on one application; is this system beneficial for reading human emotions in a classroom setting? People have mixed feelings about this, but this essay will focus on why this new FACS is not extremely valuable for reading emotional expressions in a classroom setting.

First, what can this new emotion reader do? Well, this thing can read all of the emotions on the face of the Mona Lisa. Not just one or two, but four emotions at once, and balance the percentages for each emotion, to let you know exactly how much of each emotion the person is feeling. This could have some really cool applications, like being able to tell what emotions someone was trying to convey in a drawing, or being able to tell what kinds of things you like or dislike, based off your expressions when you are shown different advertisements. There is so much you can do with this new technology, and there is a lot of uses that it has. However, the things you can do in a school setting are just mediocre.

There is a lot that sounds like cool things you can use this application for in school. In the text it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" The text also says,""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This sounds like a really good thing. However, instead of a computer system having to recognize when a student gets confused or bored, the student can just speak up and say something about it. That is not all, though. The computer system could either, one, misread a student's expression and make the lesson harder to understand or take a lot longer, or two, the student might just start drifting away and thinking about something else that is really confusing, like Einstein's theory of relativity. The computer, in turn, would make the lesson modified when it doesn't need to be, and have so many modifications that the student gets completely lost and doesn't understand anything that is happening in the lesson, just because he or she started to think about something else for a couple of seconds.

Lastly, this facial recognition system could seem like a pretty big invasion of privacy. Do people want everyone to know every single emotion they ever feel? Do they want all their teachers to know that they find what they are talking about boring? No, they do not, at least for the most part. Systems like these are getting pretty close to almost being able to know what someone is thinking, and most people don't want everyone to know what they are thinking about. The text says, ""The new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" This text says that the system can detect your emotions, but also your mixed emotions. Going back to the Mona Lisa example, the software can track the exact amount of emotions that you have, and the percentages of the emotions that you are feeling. This seems way too much like an invasion of privacy, given that people are giving what their feeling, and all of it too, away to a computer system, that can be tracked or looked at by anyone. Now maybe the system will only give what you are feeling to a teacher, or maybe it will not even do that, and function as a one-on-one learning guide. Even still, their are various ways to get into computer and technological programs, and forcing kids to give away all their emotions just for a possible improved and modified lesson seems like way too much to force someone to do, for that amount of a reward.

So, the FACS could have numerous practical applications for entertainment purposes and other purposes too. However, putting it at use to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom isn't one of them. In conclusion, the use of FACS in a classroom isn't worth the value that comes out of it, as it could have better applications elsewhere, it could glitch out or misread emotions, it could read emotions that the student is feeling about something else rather than the classroom, and finally, an appliclation that can read all of your expressions and convey them to other people is a pretty huge invasion of privacy, and forcing people to use this program is not worth the value of a slightly modified lesson for each individual. In the end, FACS is more useful as an entertainment device rather than having a school setting application. This technolgy has great value in so many areas, but schooling just isn't one of them.",0
"Venus is really dangerous. All of ""The challenge Of Explroing Venus"" is about exploring Venus. If you go and explore it be ready to be hurt when your done exploring Venus. Nasa is trying to get a big blimp to hover over Venus so you dont hurt yourself inside Venus.

How Venus is really dangerous? People have been up their and said that there are really bad surface conditions. In Pargaraph 4 it is saying ""long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth"". Thats how bad they are saying it could be really dangerous inside of Venus. So to fix the problem of people getting hurt now NASA is trying to get a 30 or so mile blimp to hover over the roiling Venusian landscape. At the endof the article It says that they strived to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endavors. At the end of all of this i would still not go because you dont know what is around it or in it to get you hurt.

The purpose of this essay is persuade people not to go to Venus beause its deadly. I dont kno if i would trust the inside of Venus or a 30 or miles so blimp floating of the landscape. Never go to Venus because of what can happen to you while your in it or out.",0
"Do you think a problem should be looked at from one person or multiple people? I think problems should be looked at from multiple people because multiple opinions make better choices because it can be seen from multiple points of view, it could help you change the outcome and, it could help you make better choices in the future.

Seeing something from multiple points of view could help you make a better choice. It can help you make a better choice because other people might know more then you and that can help you if you are in a problem that other people can help with.

When multiple people say their opinion it can help you change the outcome. Lets say that you are in a problem and the outcome is bad, so other people say what they would do. You can change the outcome and you can change it into a better outcome.

When people give you advice in the future, it can help you make better choices in the future. Lets say that you just finished high school so you can mentor students that need help in high school. So you are giving the advice to other students that need help.

My conclusion for this is multiple opinions make better choices because it can be seen from multiple points of view, it could help you change the outcome and, it could help you make better choices in the future. So are you going to take advice from others and make a better choice?",0
"In my opinion, no the use of technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Do I believe computers are smart? Sure. But computers arent as smart as humans. Computers do what us humnas tell them to do. I don't believe they can be so advanced as to be asble to read our emotions.

Humans can't always identify another humans emotions, so how can a computer? There's people out in the world whos regular face looks like they're sad, mad, angry, happy, etc. The computers going to pick up that they're always the same emotion, no mater what the situation. Not only that, but there are tons more emotions then the classified six basic ones. Dr. Paul Eckman's FACS picks us just 6 emotions? If thats the case, the computers missing at least hundred other emtions. What about the other emotions? If someone is concerned, unpleased, or please is the computer going to be able to pick that up?

In the reading it says that Dr. Huang states that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" How? Like i said before, computers do what we want them too. So how can they read our face expressions? Point blank, they can't. If the world agrees on using this technology for students in the classroom, its a bad idea.

To start with, is a invasion of privacy. If students dont want the teachers know if they're sad or in fear of something, then the teachers dont need to know. Nor do the other students or memebers of the school. If the teachers want to know if the students are bored, or uninterested the teacher should be able to ask the class 'Are you interested in this topic?"" ""Is this topic boring you."" Not being able to look at a screen and count how many are interested and how many are not

Second off Teachers are here to teach us, not be our parents and have pep talks with us. Is school about socializing and meeting people? Yes, to some extent it is. But school is for learning and preparing us for life out of school. Many schools talk about ""Oh, the consulers are here for you if you need to talk."" ""We want you to come and talk to us if something is wrong."" Seriously? That's all wrong. Am I the only kid that had to fill out a ""slip"" and waited until the consuler got with me? Uh, isnt it suppose to be the other way around? Being able to have a technology that can read the students expressions or emotions isnt right, it's honestly kind of dumb. The computer can pick up the six basic emotions right? So what happens if a students wants to get out of class? Does he or she put on a sad face and when the teacher notices sends them to the office? Kids arent dumb these days. We know how to work around the technology and beat the system.

In my opinion technology is getting out of hand. How long ago was that painting painted? A hundred years ago? I don't know. But how can we be so sure that back then people knew what emotions were? Was Mona Lisa really disgusted? If so, about what? Or was she really fearful? What was she so fearful about? What about being angry? Why was she angry? Why was she 4 emotions all at once? I dont know about you, but i've never had more then 2 emotions i felt at one time.

After reading this article and seeing my opinion it should be clear that i say no to having this in the classroom. I believe that thistechnology about reading emotions, shouldnt have even been invented.",0
"Vauban, Germany, home to 5,500 residents is taking a new rout to life... without cars. In this community street parking, drivewaves, and home garages are almost non-exsistant. The streets are ""car free"" except for the main thoroughfare. Cars are allowed, but there's only two places for parking: large garages and the edge of a development where the car owner has to pay 40,000 for the car space and buy the home.

70% of the people in Vauban don't own cars, and 54% have giving up their cars to live there. They feel happier without them. This is trending in Europe, people are calling it ""smart planning"" and it's also trending in the United States considering we have 50% green house gas from auto mobiles. With the less parking places, stores are just a short walk away from you.

In Paris they banned driving for a little while because of the almost record high pollution. Drivers on Monday with even numbered license plates were not permited into the streets or would get a 22 euro fine, and the same deal to odd numbered drivers the next day. 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 cars were impounded for their reaction to the fine. It's not as easy for the people in Paris to get used to a car free community like the people in Vauban. Although the cogestion was brought down 60% in France's capital.

In Bogota, Colombia  millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during their car free day. This is their 3rd year of celebrating a day withouth cars in the capitol. The rain didn't stop people from participating either. This day, even just one day lowers their air polution and help realize the stress of driving. Two other cities in Columbia participated in this event, Cali and Valledupar.

The United States is also trying to make great changes to reduce green house gas polution. Statics show that people are buying less cars, driving less, and getting less license plates each year. With the changes and reduction each year, it will do great things to our envirmoent and the air we breathe. Although this would not help our economy, the car industry will be troubled. Driving by young people decresed 23 between 2001 and 2009. This could help us but also put our country more into debt.",0
"Everyone today believes that having a car is the best thing for them. Truthfully, it is not. Not having a car can prevent from polluting the earth and benefit us as people in a much better way. Not having a car will stop accidents, prevent deaths, and save you money.

In Vauban, many families now do not own cars. Heidrum Walter states ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Not having a car could actually make you a much happier person as well. You would'nt have to worry about spending too much money on gas or even getting into accidents. If you have to go somewhere far, you can just hop on a subway or pay for a taxi. I know, your probaly thinking: Paying for a taxi or paying for a subway ticket cost money but definitely not nearly as much as having a car.

Next, without having to drive cars, our air we breath in will be much less polluted then it would be with cars. Paris eventually ended up on banning driving because the smog was so harsh to the environment. Anyone who drove cars were then fined. According to the article ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France."" Congestion is car traffic so therefore, there was less smog in the air. In the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota , it states ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines."" Anyone who violated the rule was then fined a specific amount to stop the people from driving cars. Businessesman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated that ""It's a good opportunity to take stress and lower air polution."" Not owning a car can help you and your family become closer because you will have to walk places together, it will help you stay fit and it will benefit the companies because they will start to boom. In source 4, Michael Sivak says ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" This means that more families are getting rid of their cars then they ever have before which will make the families closer. Walking everywhere will help you stay fit because your walking not sitting. Last but not least, companies will begin to boom. Source 3 states that ""uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks: rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic: and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" They are trying everything they can to make this world a better place. They are redoing a bunch of stuff just to show that they care. So lets show them that we care about our world too.

So lets think about the benefits of not having a car. You will be less stressed, you'll be in less accidents and you will save money. If I could have that decision I totally would take it. It is benifical for all of us so lets just live life healthy.",0
"The Face on Mars, is it really what NASA says it is? The Face on Mars is really what they say it is;a face on Mars. Most belivers in the alien world believe that aliens did do it, while most scientist do not. I am a scientist at NASA working on the ""project"" and most scientist believe that it was just a giant mesa or a ""mountain"" or something that was formed by natural effect.

I see why most belivers, in aliens, believe that aliens did it; its out of the ordnary,just not answerable,or because it's more questionable than anything. Now you can go around saying that aliens did do it, but be positve and ahve evidence on why you think that. In April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Cydonia, for the first time ever, and snapped a very ""sharp"" picture of the ""site'.

Web surfers were anxious while waiting for the image to be reveled on the JPL web page. The image showed what appeared to be just a natural landfoorm, not an alien monument or anything that had to do with aliens at all.

The belivers in aliens were still not satiisfied on the image they had seen on the internet due to the weather that day. Belivers thougth that the alien makers were just covered up by the haze or fog. Then the next time on April 8, 2001 on a cloudless day the ""reasearchers"" spotted the face again after a complete orbit around Mars and snapper another quick shot. It wasn't as easy as it sounded, they had to roll the spaceraft 25 degrees to the middle so you could see the face entirely.

After they had gotten the second picture they ""blew it up"" and made it 3 times bigger than its original size. When that happened, you could see anything and everything else that was around on the planet in that particular spot, if there were any airplanes or any other pyrmids. The picture acutally showed that it is the, Martian equivalent, size of a buttle or (a. k. a. a mesa) which are landforms most commonly made by nature in the American West.

""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Gavin. ""Thats's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

I hope this has convienced you to believe that the picture is real and that aliens did not build it and that the pictures and people that have spoken told you that it is just a natural landform that was created by ""mother-nature.""",0
"People often get stuck in serious situations, where they have to make important decisions. They usually get advice from more than one person. People may ask for advice from more than one person because, you can get more help finding the best outcome,and you get to look at at the situation from another point of view.

When you get advice from more than one person, you can find a great outcome in a much easier way. For example, "" I facetime my best friend and my cousin and say, "" I need help with finding something to wear to school tomorrow."" My cousin says I should wear a skirt because it's cute and very trendy, but my best friend said I should wear my new overalls because, it's cold outside and and they could be the new 2020 trend.

I took my time to compare the outcome and then i made my decision. "" When you want two different things you can ask others to help make the decision.

Another reason why it's good to get advice from more than one person is that you can look at the situation from another point of view. For example, two of my friends see why the choice you're making is right and my other friends can see why it's wrong. I think to myself about how the point of view is different and which one I think can have the best outcome. You'll realize the differences in the outcome and make the best decision.

As you can see, when you get advice from multiple people, you're going to get the best option.

Advice from other people can help you get through things that you can't get through alone. As the old saying says ""Two heads are always better than one.""",0
"25 Years ago NASA got a picture of Mars that there Viking 1 took and it apears to be a facial features in it. Then Viking 2 got another picture of it with more of a shawdow effect. It was a very clear picture of a face looking back at the camrea. The photo shows a gray piee of land with some bumps that look like they can be facial features.

It became very popular. It was in movies magazines grocrey stores, and even talkshows. It caused a really big scene. People were arguing weather its right or not. Between people deciding weather its real or not. NASA was trying to get more images of it. So they can finally see what it is.

People got alot of ideas on what it might be. An alien, ghost or maybe even another human race. They waited pationtly/ impationly for them do release new pictures for more proof. People were longing for more answers, so Garvin gave it to them.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to get some better pictures. So on a cloudless day, Garvin took a picture, revealing that ot was just a landform and not an actual face.

But he also said it is very hard trying to hard to pass over that face and they dont pass over ot very often.

It is very clear that it is not an actual face, but people still didn't settle for it. They wanted more answers, but thats all they can get. A

better, sharper image showing that it's not a face, but a landform.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere to limit and reduce car usage. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more sustainable communities. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage based on ideas and information from a set of passages.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to experts, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the reliance on cars, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint and contribute to the fight against climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the creation of more compact and accessible suburbs. The example of Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, demonstrates how limiting car ownership can lead to the development of walkable streets and public transportation infrastructure. In Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and residents have access to a tram that takes them to downtown Freiburg. This model is being adopted in different parts of the world, with stores placed within walking distance and an emphasis on public transportation rather than distant highways.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improvements in air quality. The case of Paris, which enforced a partial driving ban due to smog, shows how reducing car usage can help clear the air in congested cities. During the ban, congestion in Paris decreased by 60 percent, and the smog level dropped significantly. This improvement in air quality contributes to the health and wellbeing of the citizens.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, attracted millions of participants, and other Colombian cities joined the event. The car-free day not only reduced traffic congestion but also provided an opportunity for people to experience alternative modes of transportation, such as biking, walking, and taking public buses. This shift towards alternative transportation can save money for individuals and reduce the strain on public infrastructure.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to changes in cultural attitudes towards transportation. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses. This shift in behavior, if sustained, can have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment. In addition, the rise of telecommuting, shared van services, and car-sharing programs shows that people are finding alternative ways to commute and travel without relying solely on personal vehicles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has various advantages that contribute to a more sustainable and livable environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating compact and accessible suburbs, improving air quality, and promoting alternatives to personal vehicles, communities can move towards a more sustainable future. It is important for individuals and policymakers to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and support initiatives that encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation.",1
"The internet has revolutionized the way we communicate, shop and search for information. One of the great advancements in technology that has come about as a result of this is online shopping. Shopping online provides a level of convenience and affordability that brick-and-mortar stores simply cannot compete with. With so many websites offering different products at competitive prices, it can be hard to know where to start when shopping online. One place to begin is by understanding which payment method works best for you. Most websites will accept credit cards or debit card payments, while some may also provide options such as PayPal or other electronic wallets like Apple Pay or Google Pay. It's important to take into consideration any fees associated with these types of transactions before committing to a particular payment method in order to ensure you're getting the best deal possible. Additionally, keep an eye out for discounts and promotional codes – these are often widely available on social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook - which could save you even more money!. Before clicking ""Purchase Now,"" be sure read through all fine print regarding shipping policies, return policies, product warranties etc., so there aren't any surprises down the line if something goes wrong with your purchase or if you need to make a return or exchange the item(s). Whenever possible try opting for expedited delivery over standard ground because it tends to offer greater peace-of-mind knowing your items have been delivered quicker than expected should they become lost in transit due unforeseen circumstances beyond either party’s control (e.g., inclement weather). Plus most companies will usually allow returns within thirty days after purchase date allowing ample time should you change your mind about purchasing something without causing too much hassle trying arrange its timely return back—in unused condition—to get refunded what was initially paid minus applicable restocking fees depending on individual retailer’s policy before deciding against keeping item purchased via their website unless exchanged instead returning after exceeding allowable grace period given initial retraction terms

"Yes, I do think that we should use the Facial Action Coding in classroom. The reason why I say yes is because students do get bored and frustrated when doing notes or homework and even inclass work. The Facial Action Coding would allow the teachers to really see how or what there students emotions when it comes to doing there work, the teacher can change things up to making the class fun when they are doing note or work. Also the teacher can understand what's going on with his or her students in the classroom to see if they are struggling or if they get on how to do the work. I think math teachers would really would like to have this because, they would be able to tell if the students are lying to them on if they get it or if they don't get it. So the teacher would be able to help the students more that are struggling with the work. Also other classes than just math the teachers would be able to use it for helping there students in class that are actually not getting on how to do the work or if they do or don't understand the note. Like in a history class alot of time it can be very confusing and the students don't understand on how to do the teacher would be able to know if they really get it or they are just lying straight to there faces. The teachers would also know if they are having a good or a bad day, if they student is having a bad day they could some how cheer them up to make them happier in there class or the rest of the day.",0
"I remember when asking in math class on how to do something and if there are other ways to do it and feeling the movement of my pencil and hearing on what it had to say when being written down. What is happening there is that I knew one way to do it but I wanted to know if there was other ways to do it. And if so which way I pick would be the easier way for me to get my answer for that type of problem. When seeking multiple opinion it can help someone make a better choice because it can help them lead in to a better option and help them show different ways on how to do something.

First reason on when seeking multiple opinion to make a person choice better is because it can help them lead into a better choice. When answering question on paper people may ask the teacher to ask to help them or a friend to help them with it. For example, when I don't know something I ask a friend or my teacher to help me lead to a better choice for that problem. So when people have math class they might ask a question if they can help the or a friend to dot he same. For example, when I in math class and some of friends who don't get it, I tell them the way to do it and lead them in the way to the right answer.

Second reason when seeking multiple opinion to help someone make a better choice is because it can help them show different ways to do it. When doing math there can be different ways on how to do something like your times table. For example, When I do my times table I just know it but for other I would use a calculator for it or just do it myself. Another way in math is when you divide because just like you when you times something there are different ways on how to do something. For example, in math I just know it but if I don't then I use a calculator to help me with that question.

In conclusion, when seeking multiple opinion it can help someone by making a better choice because it can show them different ways on how to do it and lead them to a better option. Just like when I was in math feeling that the way I knew was to hard I found a different one and made my life easier. An when seeking multiple option it can help you thing differently, and if knowing if there are other ways to do something. Just like when you are in math learning the other ways to do something or by show a friend the easier for you that you use. By that that just show that mulitlple option can help you or someone else to make the better choice.",0
"Dear Senator,

I think the United States of America should change or abolish the Electoral College because sometimes it is not actually what the people want. In the 2000 Election Al Gore won the popular vote meaning more people in the USA wanted him at President than the winner. Should'nt we give the people what they want? A poll states thart over 60% of United States voters want to change or get rid of the Electoral College for this exact reason. The state sends people to represent the State not to represent the people. The state or people in office could totally defy whatever the people want in that state.

Lets say there is a tie. Then every state would have only 1 vote meaning the little state of Delaware would have as much say as the huge state of California. This example is the complete opposite of doing what the people want.This means the 35 million people have as much say as the 500,000 or sol in Delaware. Our government bases off what the people want but the Electoral College dosen't always base off what the people more than what the state wants itself.

Each party representing the state selects the ""trusted"" people for each state. What if those people have a change of heart and they decide to change towards something the state dosen't want. (Which is very possible) Then what would happen? Would either the Democrats or Republicans really be elected or would it just be 270 people in the room just be deciding whatever they want?

Sincerly,

"I think that we should change to popular vote for president of the United States. Instead of the electorsal College. I think this for a lot of reasons, one is because you dont vote for the president but for the electorss. It is unfair because they have a winner takes all system. Also if there is a tie the state gets to decide. electorss can defy the will of the people. The electorsal college should be changed to popular vote for the president.

First, you have to vote for the electorss not the president. Then only if they win there votes go through. You can't even control who the electorss vote for. Voters sometimes get confused on who there voting for and vote for the wrong electors. Over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election than what we have now.

Then, they have the winner takes all system. Also candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. Seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. states like Rhode Island, South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even see a campaign ad. Though they established electorsal college in the constitution Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO all, agreed on abolishing the electorsal college.

Lastly, electers can defy the will of the people. The state legislatures are resposible for picking the electorss. If there is a tie between the electorss then the state gets to decide. Richard Nixon was presiding over the senate he then validated only his opponent's electorss. He made sure to do so without establishing a precedent. What if this possibly happens again?

The electorsal college should be changed to popular vote for the president. This should be done because the electorsal college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. You also dont vote for the president you vote for the electorss. Its also unfair because of the winner takes all system. Also if there is a tie the state gets to vote for the president. The electorsal college should be changed to the popular vote for the president, because the electorss can defy the will of the people.",0
"In the modern era, the accumulation of knowledge has reached unprecedented levels. The explosion of information has led to a proliferation of fields of study and specialization, which in turn has created a world in which people tend to operate within narrow and specific areas of expertise. While this trend has undoubtedly led to significant advancements in science and technology, it has also created a divide between fields of specialization that can make it difficult for experts from different disciplines to influence one another. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement, as there are both positive and negative outcomes of this phenomenon.

On the one hand, the increase in specialization has led to a wealth of new discoveries and innovations in various fields. By focusing their efforts on a specific area of expertise, researchers and scientists have been able to uncover new insights and develop new technologies that would have been impossible to achieve without such focus. For example, advances in medical science have led to the development of targeted therapies for diseases such as cancer, while developments in computer science have led to the creation of sophisticated algorithms that can predict human behavior.

On the other hand, the specialization-driven divide between fields of expertise can also lead to a lack of communication and collaboration between experts in different areas. This can lead to missed opportunities and stifle innovation. For example, scientists working on environmental issues may not consider the impact of their research on social and economic factors, while social scientists may not take into account the environmental impact of their proposed policies. This can result in policies and solutions that are only partially effective, if not completely inadequate.

Furthermore, the lack of cross-disciplinary communication can also create a situation in which specialists become isolated within their own fields, making it difficult for them to apply their knowledge to real-world problems. For example, an expert in climate science may have little knowledge of the economic and political factors that contribute to climate change, making it difficult for them to develop effective policies and solutions. Similarly, an economist may not have a deep understanding of the ecological impact of certain economic policies, making it difficult for them to develop policies that are both economically and ecologically sustainable.

In order to overcome the limitations of specialization-driven divide, it is important to foster communication and collaboration between experts in different fields. This can be achieved through various means, such as cross-disciplinary conferences, joint research projects, and interdisciplinary degree programs. By bringing experts from different fields together and promoting communication and collaboration, it is possible to create a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of complex issues, leading to more effective policies and solutions.

In conclusion, while the increase in specialization has undoubtedly led to significant advancements and discoveries in various fields, it has also created a divide between fields of expertise that can make it difficult for experts from different disciplines to influence one another. To overcome the limitations of specialization-driven divide, it is important to foster communication and collaboration between experts in different fields, enabling them to work together to develop more comprehensive and effective solutions to complex problems.

"To conserve energy and resources, some bussines have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consist of ten hours. In my opinion, this idia would bring benefits for some students and disavantages too. For example the students who really like the school it would be a great idia, to be doig team-progets or just spend time with friends and teachers. In the other hand some students don't really like to be 8 hours in the school so I just realize that they would not agree with that idea.

A mayor porcent of the students wo don't like school, decide to quit or just apply to an elective shool. Like in my case olmost 1 year ago i decide to start going to an elective school, the reason is that I work a full tme job after school and it was difficult to arrive on time everyday to the basic school. I thing the idea of adding 2 hours more to the schedule of the basic school is not a good idia, because students who are in the high school and have a job as a part-time or even a full time would decide to apply to a basic school. I mean a basic school is better for the students who work at the same time they canmake their schedule smaller and have enough time to sleep, work, and to study. In conclusion, this is my point of view.",0
"A city council is debating the adoption of a 10 p. m. weekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. If the curfew is adopted, teenagers on the streets after those hours would be breaking the law. Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, or do they unfairly interfere in young people lives?

Curfew helps young kids to stay out of trouble because it can be dangerous. For example, if they just wording around at night they don't know what can happened like they can get kidnap, and be at a place at a wrong time. They can think it's cool but in reality it's not. If a police men stop or pull you over you can get in to trouble because they gonna ask if your parents know you out or if they know where you at and if you said no they gonna call you parents and ask them to come and get you.

Sometimes your parents can get worry if you not home. Kids want to meet up with there friends just to hang out but is it really worth it or to get in trouble knowing your friends ain't gonna have your back. Curfew keep teens from getting in trouble. Although curfew can be good but it shows that your parents can trust you. Night can be really dangerous because you can't see in the dark and you don't know what can be out there. There can be drunk drivers at night also.

Curfew is a law so if you go out late at night you would be breaking the law. Police man really do be canning this serious. All they want is kids to stay safe and be good also to listen to their parents. Teens think that meeting up with there friends at night is cool. But parents just want there kids to behave and listen so they won't get in serious trouble. Why lose your parent trust over some friends that ain't gonna talk to you later in life. Be smart on what side you try to be. Not everything is all about friends you gotta put your parents first then your friends that why them made a curfew.

Plus it the matter of respect for your parents.

Curfew actually helps teens from doing wrong things. Teens don't think that there parents gonna find out but when they get that call saying mom you gonna get nervous or scared because you dont't know what to say for being at late. Parents can be smart at times when they want to but they do be catching here kids in the act of sneaking out ! Teens really do have a choice by picking stay home or go out and have fun. People really care about this law. Who wanna see a kid walking alone without no parent around. Teens just need to sleep or play on there gaming systems . You can hang out with your friends during the day or have a sleep over . Whatever you can do to hang out with your friends but DON'T GO SNEKING OUT TO GO GET FOOD OR TO BE WITH YOUR GRILFRIEND! Just stay at home call up your friends or even your girlfriend so you won't put your self at a higher risk of getting in trouble.

Overall just stay out of trouble and have your parents trust. Don't do nothing stuiped. Stay at home make do homework or watch a movie just don't sneake out jsut to do stuff thats gonna get you in trouble.",0
"I agree that people should get the help, so they can make great decisions. Because the other person could probably be wrong with somethings. Also the other person doesn't have any saying in your life, if you don't want them to. And you are the only person who can change the outcome of your life. even so your the main person in your life, its okay to hear others out even though they are wrong sometimes or if they are sometimes right.

The first reason is that its okay if you don't want the other person's help. But you should hear them out so you can get something out of thing. For example my friend Generic_Name, she love to write stories and love to sing, and dance, but she too embarrassed to do what she love. So one day I gave her some ideas, but she didn't want any, because she don't want to do them, but next day, she gave some of my ideas a try and she like it but still don't want to do it anymore. But long as she listened that good enough for me.

The second reason is people don't have any saying in your life, yes its true, but theres people willing to help you through your life. But it only depend on you, if you want their help or not. For a example my sister Generic_Name doesn't want help from me nor our parents. But its okay, because she know that we want to help her, because we care about her,so we will not stop trying to help her. But there is times she let us help her out with her life, and that's good. Longs she lets us in her life, thats good enough for us.

Last reason is you still are the main person in your life, so no matter what you do your life, just remember it your life is your alone, and you are the only one who can change the outcome of your future. even If you want the help of others or not. For example I'm 18 years ago, and i'm still having problems in my life, but there are people that are willing to help me, but i'm scared at no matter what i'm still feeling down with stuff. But no matter what they are still willing to help me. And i'm happy, so yeah thats good for me.

So basically, NO MATTER WHAT THERE'S ALWAYES WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WANTS TO HELP YOU. So its good to get some advice and wisdom from others. even though you don't want the help, its still good to get some advice from others.",0
"There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on what is meant by ""understand ideas and concepts."" If it means understanding the underlying principles behind a fact, then I agree that this is more important than simply knowing the fact it'self. If, on the other hand, it means understanding every detail of a fact, then I disagree, as there is simply too much information for any one person to know.

For example, a student who understands the basic principles of economics will be able to apply those principles to a variety of real-world situations, whereas a student who knows all the specific details of economic theory will be able to do little more than recite those details. Similarly, a student who understands the general concepts behind the French Revolution will be able to understand the broad strokes of that event, whereas a student who knows all the specific dates and names involved will be able to tell you little more than that.

In many cases, it is simply not possible for a student to learn every fact. There are too many facts, and they are changing too rapidly. Even if a student could learn all the facts, those facts would be outdated by the time the student graduated. In contrast, if a student understands the principles behind a fact, those principles will still be valid no matter how much the facts change.

For these reasons, I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

"Advice, we all need it, and sometimes we need multiple opinions. We make decisions everyday, for example; ""Should I eat pancakes or eggs for breakfast,"" or, ""Should I do my laundry?"" but when seeking advice on a decision that is harder to make people usually go to who they trust most, but sometimes you need more than that. Going to different people can be helpful with these harder decisions because everyone has different points of view, and experiences.

When you need advice, going to different people can be helpful because they all have different points of view. This can lead to different outcomes and with that you always want another opinion. When looking at the different points of view you can always think through what might happen in that situation. For example, one time I needed advice on whether I should retake a unit test for math; one of my friends said to retake the test because she was thinking of helping my grade; my other friend said not to because it would stress me out. In the end, I went with the first option because my grade was important to me at the time. Decisions can be hard, but getting advice from others on what to do can help immensely.

Another reason why getting advice from different people can help is that they all have different experiences to learn from. Sometimes listening to what others have gone through helps with a decision because you can imagine what might happen through their words. For example; I was deciding whether or not I wanted to go to school on the last day. I asked two friends; one said that I shouldn't go because we weren't going to be doing much and from their experience the last day is never fun; the other said I should go because you never know how eventful the day might be and from their experience sometimes the last day is a lot of fun. When it came down to the wire I decided not to go because in the long run going that day wasn't going to benefit me.

Going to different people for advice can be helpful with harder decisions because everyone has different points of view, and experiences. Learn and grow from each other, and always make the decision that is beneficial to who it affects. In the long run these small decisions can lead to one big decision and knowing you have people to help and to give you advice is important.",0
"Education is one of the most important aspects of a nation's development, and it is essential that every student receives a quality education. To achieve this goal, some countries require all students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college. While this approach has it's advantages, I disagree with this perspective, as it limits creativity, stifles critical thinking and fails to cater to the diverse needs of students.

Firstly, requiring students to study the same national curriculum limits their creativity. Every student has a unique set of skills and talents that should be nurtured and developed. However, a standardized curriculum leaves no room for creativity or individuality. This can lead to disengagement from learning, as students may feel that their interests and skills are not valued in the classroom. As a result, they may not develop to their fullest potential, and this can have long-lasting effects on their personal and professional lives.

Secondly, a standardized curriculum can stifle critical thinking. A national curriculum is designed to provide students with a specific set of skills and knowledge, but it may not be suitable for all learners. In some cases, students may find that the curriculum is outdated or irrelevant to their interests and needs. This can prevent them from developing the critical thinking skills necessary to succeed in the modern world. By encouraging students to think critically, teachers can challenge their assumptions and encourage them to explore different perspectives, which will help them to become more creative and innovative.

Finally, a standardized curriculum fails to cater to the diverse needs of students. Every student is unique, and their educational needs vary. For example, some students may excel in mathematics, while others may have a natural talent for the arts. A standardized curriculum may not be able to cater to the diverse needs of students, leading to a lack of engagement and motivation. In contrast, a more flexible curriculum can be tailored to meet the needs of each student, helping them to achieve their full potential.

In conclusion, while a standardized national curriculum has it's advantages, I do not agree with this approach. Requiring all students to study the same curriculum until they enter college limits creativity, stifles critical thinking, and fails to cater to the diverse needs of students. Instead, schools should focus on providing a more flexible curriculum that encourages creativity, critical thinking, and caters to the diverse needs of every student. This approach will help to ensure that every student receives a quality education and achieves their full potential.

"Imagine a world completely pollution free. A world with no worry about greenhouse gases or global warming. While it's highly unlikely that we will get to that point, we can still try to reach this perfectly healthy world.

Stress is a feeling that everyone can relate to. Whether it be work, school, money, or home life stressing out about things is not healthy. There has been several studies showing that getting proper exercise has tremendous health benefits. The only problem is that no one ever seems to have time to work out or go on a walk. However, if you had to walk to get wherever you're going, you would easily receive enough exercise to help lower your stress. Plus, driving can be extremely stressful. Without having to sit through traffic or deal with bad drivers an average person's stress levels would plummet. The first passage contains a quote from a suburban mom of two, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm so much happier this way."" Recently, I feel as if all I hear about on the news is Greenhouse gases and pollution. Honestly, hearing about global warming is a frightening experience, almost like a glass of cold water being thrown in your face. 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are caused by passenger cars and in parts of the United States it's up to 50 percent! While car companies are helping by rolling out hybrid and electric cars, those cars are very expensive! Not everyone is willing to shell out that kind of money. By reducing car use, the harmful gases polluting our air will greatly decrease and places like Paris,France and Beijing, China both ver heavily polluted places can have clearer air.

Money. Money seems like it rules our world and it really does. Do you enjoy throwing money away? Of course you don't! Well, if you drive a car everywhere you go, you might as well be. Gas prices are high and it takes upwards of 50 dollars to fill the tank of the average car. Not to mention the price of the car itself! While you have to pay for gas, car insurance, maintenance, and the bill for the car if it's not paid off yet, people who walk to work or to the store and don't own a car are saving thousands of dollars a year.

To conclude, when you reduce the use of cars you: reduce stress, reduce the amount of pollution, and save money. If you want to leave the planet Earth healthy and livable for the future generations, you should seriously consider ditching your car and buying a nice pair of walking shoes.",0
"When peoples ask for advices, they sometimes talks to more than one person. This can helps them makes a betters choise for many reesons.

First, gettings many opinions can helps peoples see diffrent sides of a problem. For example, if someones askes their friends and family members about a big desission, they might gets many diffrent ansers. Some peoples might say yes, some might say no, and some might say maybe. This can helps the person see all the diffrent ways to look at the problem and make a more informed desission.

Another reeson why seeking multiplie opinions can helps is that it can helps peoples avoids biases. If someone only asks one person for advice, they might gets a biased anser. For example, if someone asks their best friend for advice, their friend might say yes just because they want to be supportive. But if they asks many peoples, they might gets a more balanced view and avoids biases.

Finally, seeking multiplie opinions can helps peoples feels more confident in their choise. When peoples talks to many peoples, they can sees that there are many diffrent ways to look at a problem. This can helps them feels more confident that they are making the rite choise.

In conclusion, seeking multiplie opinions can helps peoples makes a betters choise by helping them see diffrent sides of a problem, avoids biases, and feels more confident in their choise. So, next time you have a big desission to make, don't be affraid to talks to many peoples and gets many opinions!",1
"In the past two decades, we have seen a massive shift in the way people move around cities. In the 1990s, cars were the primary mode of transportation in most developed countries. Today, however, cars are being used less and less, replaced by public transportation, bicycles, and walking. This trend is only going to continue in the next twenty years. There are several reasons for this.

First, cars are becoming increasingly expensive. The cost of buying a car, as well as the cost of maintaining one, has been rising steadily for years. This is due to a number of factors, including the increasing price of oil and the fact that cars are getting more and more complex. As cars become more expensive, fewer people can afford to own one.

Second, cars are becoming less necessary. In the past, cars were the only way to get around in many places. Today, however, there are often alternative methods of transportation, such as public transportation, bicycles, and walking. These alternatives are often cheaper and more convenient than cars.

Third, cars are becoming more dangerous. The number of car accidents and fatalities has been increasing for years. This is due to a number of factors, including distracted driving and the increasing number of cars on the road. As cars become more dangerous, fewer people want to use them.

Fourth, cars are becoming more polluting. Cars produce a large amount of pollution, which is harmful to the environment. As the world becomes more aware of the need to protect the environment, fewer people want to use cars.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why cars are being used less and less. This trend is only going to continue in the next twenty years.

"May 24, 2001 was the date it all started. When the ""Face on Mars"" conspiracy began. NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was circling a region of Mars called Cydonia. The Viking 1 was taking snapshots of the Cydonia when it spoted a shadowy figure close of a human face. This snapshot was sent to the Viking 1's sister ship Viking 2. After careful review at the mission controllers at the Jet Propulision Lab they found out that it wasn't a human face. It turned out to be Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia. Although this one had an unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

After a few days of the finding of the ""Face"" NASA unveiled the image for all the public to see. They added a capition to the image that quoted ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The authors used the photo as a propaganda to get the publics attention to Mars, and it rsulted on good high notes. The ""Face of Mars"" became an pop icon from starring in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkut lines for 25years! Then to clear up that the ""Face"" didn't show signs of life Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped the same image ten times sharper and it revealed a natural landform. There was no alien momument after all. They tried another picture after people wouldn't believe the landform idea and the Martian came equivalent of a butte or mesa. Jim Garvin said it reminded him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

In conclusion the image of the ""Face On Mars"" sparked contrivsory in if it was a face or a natural landfrom. You had all the public believing it was a face and NASA saying it was a landform. This challenged NASA to prove that the face was indeed a landfrom. They got sharper images in where it clearly shows a butte/mesa. Although the public didn't believe in NASA it sure did make NASA have a reason for its reaseach. The shared their discoveries with everyone and the public responded. Which I say it was what NASA wanted all along.",0
"In recent years, the access to government proceedings on television has become more and more widespread. From trials to debates, meetings, and other important events, citizens can now tune in to view their government at work. Some people argue that this is a positive development for society since it helps people understand the issues that affect their lives. In this essay, I will argue that I fully agree with this statement.

To begin with, watching government proceedings on TV can help people stay informed about important issues that affect their lives. For instance, televised debates between political candidates can provide valuable information about their plans for the future. Citizens can then make informed decisions when they vote for their preferred candidate. Similarly, watching trials on TV can help people understand the legal process and the role of the judiciary in society. This can increase people's confidence in the legal system and promote a sense of justice.

Furthermore, televising government proceedings can promote transparency and accountability in government. When citizens can view proceedings such as legislative meetings, they can see how their representatives conduct themselves and how they make decisions. This can promote transparency and accountability in government, which is essential in a democracy. When people can see how their representatives vote on issues, they can hold them accountable for their actions. This can encourage politicians to act in the best interest of their constituents and not in their own interest.

In addition, televising government proceedings can promote civic engagement and participation. By viewing proceedings such as town hall meetings or public hearings, citizens can learn about issues that affect their community. They can then participate in the decision-making process and share their views with their representatives. This can promote a sense of civic engagement and encourage citizens to take an active role in shaping their communities.

Moreover, televising government proceedings can promote education and learning. By watching proceedings such as legislative debates or court trials, citizens can learn about the political and legal processes that shape their lives. This can increase their knowledge and understanding of how government works and their role in it. This knowledge can be empowering and can motivate people to become more involved in their communities.

In conclusion, I believe that televising government proceedings is a positive development for society. By providing citizens with access to important events, such as trials, debates, and meetings, people can stay informed about the issues that affect their lives. Furthermore, televising these events can promote transparency, accountability, civic engagement, and education. These are essential values in a democracy and can help promote a more engaged and informed citizenry.

"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" thinks that exploring Venus is worth the risks that are required. Venus is a planet that most people think are a star because of how brightly it shines at night which makes it very noticeable. Not many other things are known about Venus: Not many people think about exploring Venus when they think of space exploration. In the article the author talks about both the problems with exploring Venus, but he also talks about how exploring Venus is something that is a possibility for the future.

The author states that Venus is ""often referred to as Earth's 'twin'"" because out of all the planets Venus has a similar density and size compared to Earth. The terrain of Venus is also very similar to the terrain of Earth. They both have landmarks that are similar ""to familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This evidence shows how the landscape of Venus has the possibility to be a home for humans. The similarities between Earth and Venus make Venus a valuable place to explore in greater depth.

Although Venus has a similar terrain to Earth, the ground climate is too rough for anyone to safely land in Venus. Venus has a temperature that humans can not survive in, 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Also on Venus the pressure is 90 times what humans experience on Earth. Humans have never experienced conditions as extreme as those on Venus: ""Even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of [the] oceans"" would be crushed and the high temperatures ""would liquefy many metals."" Something that was made to be able to go withstand high pressures, like a submarine, would be crushed on Venus, and metals can withstand very high temperatures but on venus they would liqeufy. It is unsafe and humanly impossible for humans to try to explore the land of Venus when some of the best technology can not even withstand the climate of Venus.

As of now there is not enough technology for humans to explore Venus on the surface, but they can explore Venus from above. It is a possibility for scientists to hover 30 miles above Venus. This way the scientists will not have to experience the total wrath of Venus's surface, but they would experince ""temperatures that would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, [and] the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" Humans can live in those conditions, even though they may not be ideal. Scientists would be able to explore Venus without putting them at risk. There is still not technology for the scientists to throughly explore Venus the way they want to. They would only get a glimpse into what Venus is like. New inivations are being worked on that can withstand Venus's tumultous surface, so that scientists can get the full picture of

Venus.

Venus has great potential for exploration, but with that great potential comes great risk. The author of the article talks about the problems with exploring Venus, but he also talks about how exploring Venus is something that is a possibilty for the future. Venus is very similar to Earth in the terrain that they both have, but the surface conditions of Venus are deadly to humans. There is the possibilty of hovering above Venus to be closer to the surface without having to experince the extreme conditions. With the advancements in technology and new innovations scientists are hoping that there is a way for them to get closer to the surface without endangering their lives.",0
"You can always ask for advice from a friend, but have you tried to seek or talk to multiple people? It's a better option. Usually when people ask for advice, they talk to more than one person. This is much better than just hearing one person's opinion. Even though sometimes someone would just like to talk to their friend for advice, maybe it could be better for that person. Seeking multiple options when asking for advice can help someone make a better choice because they might like another piece of advice better than the other and they could be more open to try more than one piece of advice at one time.

Someone might like a piece of advice better than the other. Someone might like a piece of advice better than the other because one might make them feel at ease or just be easier for them to understand while the other does not make sense or work out. For example, if someone is looking for advice on how to serve the ball better over the net in volleyball, they are not going to want to take the advice that tell them to just get stronger, they are going to take the one that helps them maybe on technique. Maybe the opposite, it depends what they are looking for. So someone liking a piece of advice better than the other is a reason that a person might talk to more than one person for advice because they might like one outlook better than the other.

Someone could want to try more than one piece of advice at one time. Trying more than one piece of advice at one time could be effective because all pieces of advice that you are taking could all be similar in some way. Using the same volleyball example, someone might say ""you need a faster arm swing"" and the other ""you need to toss the ball higher"". These are both giving that person advice on technique. If you use both, you will be happier with the results. Using more than one piece of advice is effective because both could work in the same situation.

To help someone make a better choice when asking for advice they should seek for multiple options. This is because they might like one piece of advice better than the other. One may be good for the situation, and the other may not be good. Another reason is because they might want to do or try more than one piece of advice at a time, like if all of the pieces of advice tie together, the result could be good or better. In conclusion, seek for more than one option when asking for advice because you should see all of the opportunities and ways that they could help.",0
"Limiting car usage is a good idea. Limiting cars usage it a wonderful idea for many reasons. most people have the ability to live there life without cars, this would help cut back on pollution, and for most people it would be cheaper. Although some people may see this as a impossible way of living some of us do not.

To begin, people can live without cars people have done it before us and eventually people will do it after us. As shown in source 1 these people in Vauban, Germany have given up a life of cars for a simpler much quiter life in the suburbs. Life in this city has been condensed down into a one square mile area where people are able to go on with there everyday lives without having to get into a car to go somewhere. Life in this city is does not go completely without cars if these people need to leave the city they can simply walk to their very own parking space in the parking garage right on the outskirts of the city. these people have the ability to keep there cars but they have to buy a parking space when they buy there house you also generally wouldnt need your car unless you were going on a long drive that required you to leave the city. There is also the fact that there will be a day soon when we run out of fossil fuels and what is a fossil fuel? gas. there will soon enough be a day where we dont have any gas and we will not be able to drive cars everywhere that we want.

Next, this would be one of the most effective ways to cut back on pollution. as shown in the 2nd source paris was struggling with a very bad pollution problem that they needed to deal with. Paris was having the same sort of problem that beijing, china is having and beijing is the most poluted city in the world. so they banned all the cars that ended in a even number on monday and a odd number on tuesday. Just doing this for one day cut the amount of pollution in half. Imagine our worldwide pollution levels if driving was limited. The second largest form of pollution is cars so limiting driving could even drop cars a few ranks back. Every part of getting to fossil fuels that fuel our cars is more and more pollution. gas is a very large pollutants and it causes lot of problems for our nation and one day there will be no more gas.

Furthermore, limiting driving would almost be cheaper for the people as talked about in source 4 less and less people have been getting there licenses and driving cars because it isnt needed as much anymore. there are more ways of public transit that people are taking advantage of such as the mans son who takes the Bay Area Rapid Transit instead of driving his car. some might say that taking these other forms of transportation might take longer and yes they might be right but they are also much cheeper instead of having to pay a large amount of money to first, buy a car and then, buy gas. which the gas prices only seem to be going up lately. They have the ability to buy cheep tickets for the ride on the train or maybe a bus. As i spoke about earlier we will one day run out of fossil fuels. Gas is a fossil fuel and leading up to the time where we wont have gas anymore the gas will just keep getting more and more expensive because the less gas we have in our community the more that it will cost. also the more that people will want it one day most of us will not have the money to drive cars not because of the cost of the car but because of the cost of the gas.

Coming to a end, there are many other ways to travel other than buy a vehichle and some may be easier for you cheeper for you or better for the environment so why keep on hurting the environment when you could simply make the world a better place by just not driving a car. there are many reasons to limit driving but we could easily do it because people can live without cars, it would help the environment and cut back on pollution, it would also be much cheeper.",0
"
A few years ago I made a mistake and was charged with a minor crime. I quickly learned that even small offences can lead to big consequences and have lasting effects. I was sentenced to 120 hours of community service. Although it was quite a long time to commit, I soon realized the value of giving back to the community; I met people that I would never have been connected to had I not made that mistake.

I realized how much I enjoyed the connection of helping others. Whenever I saw the impact that those hours had on the people we were helping, it re-affirmed that my time was making a difference. I grabbed every opportunity to volunteer to make sure I could make the most out of my mandated requirement. I was able to recognize the value of service and plans to stay involved with various volunteer organizations.

My experience of community service has been an eye-opening one. I have learned valuable lessons about why laws are in place and the importance of continuing to do the right thing. Furthermore, I have gained an appreciation for the communities I interact with and the need to be of service. Even if it comes from an unfortunate experience, I know now that striving to give back is a consequence that I am more than willing to take.",1
"Our country, the United States of America, needs and deserves a grand president who will work hard and inspire the citizens of this country to persevere like our forefathers have and this president needs to be voted by popular vote by hisher citizens in the United States. The presidential elections need to be of popular vote and to be voted by the citizens of America, not by some electoral college. The reason for this is that for one: the candidates ignore the smaller states, two: electors who are chosen can, and possibly will, go against the will of the people the Electoral College shows signs of inequality amongst the states, unpatrioticism, and unfairness.

If we continue to go by the electoral college, the smaller states who hold inadequate populations will continue to be ignored by the candidates running for presidency. In source 1 paragraph No. 3, it states:""Your states allotment of the electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives and 2 for your Senators."" Also, in paragraph 13 of Source No.2, it states,"" Because of the winnertakesall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning."" So, the candidates ignore the smaller states because of their smaller population and this is a sign of unfairness and inequality amongst the people of America. The future president should address and obtain votes that are from all 50 states of the United States. That is how we treat and show that every person and every state are equal to one another, and that the candidates get an honest and fair vote. The way the Electoral College does things during the presidential election is everything against how our country came to be through hardwork, a desire and wish to be equal to one another, and to ensure fairness amongst the people this Electoral College projects an unpatriotic feel and that itself should not be a process that the United States holds.

The Electoral College is unfair in the fact that the electors chosen by our state legislature can, and possibly will go against the will of the people. With the Electoral College those who vote aren't actually voting for the president but for a slate of electors that elect the president. In Source No.2 paragraph 11, it states: ""In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" This is unfair and a disrespect to a persons choice. It is an act that is untrustworthy and it could happen at any time, people might not even know it. That action practically takes away a citizens right of opinion speech which is part of the Bill of Rights, the very basis of what we have a right to have. That in itself is unAmerican and unpatriotic. This system should be overruled and abandoned for it doesn't go with the basis of our country's ways.

However, the Electoral College does have a somewhat strict rule that is rarely broken. In Source No.3 paragraph 16, it states:"" But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for that party's nominee and that trust is rarely broken.."" The Electoral College does have some points that it is not totally untrustworthy. But, this point can be broken and can be unfair for the people.

Senator, I hope these points have shown that the Electoral College needs to be voted against due to its unfairness, unpatrioticness, and its act of inequality amongst the states. This country needs it's people to vote for it's president, not a slate of electors.",0
"When people ask for advice they usually ask one person, but when they do that, their choices are limited compared to when they ask multiple people for their advice in a situation. They then can hear different points of view as they hear where other people went wrong and their experiences in that time, and how to avoid that situation. This then allows them to assess the conflict and then do what most people described as helpful.

If you ask multiple people for their opinions on it then you can get many different answers or you can get a bunch of the same answers to help your point. For instance, if you are having problems with a girl and you ask boys and girls what to do then they will give you different answers based on the fact that they have opposite views on the conflict. Girls will make it seem like you did wrong and will try to make you feel bad but when you ask ""the boys"" it makes it seem like you did no wrong and your girlfriend is mad about something else completely unrelated to that topic. But if you ask on a different topic to that thought, then you could get very, very different answers.

Like when you are going to get a brand new pair of shoes but then you don't know what to get, so you ask your friends. They then proceed and say, Parrel x Adidas Human Races, Checkerboard Vans, Old Skool Vans, Yeezy Boosst 350, or some New Balance Running shoes. Who ever you ask on a really big topic then you are going to get a wide variety of answers, some which you most likely wouldn't want to hear because of your own opinion.

It could also be if you ask them which is their favorite sport, they could say, Baseball, Football, Soccer, Volleyball, Golf, Bowling, Swimming, Hockey, Boxing, WWE, Wrestling, Fishing, etc. With this amount of options it really makes it hard to get a straight answer from the people you ask.

Also, if you need help to a math problem, not everyone is going to get the same answer. People could get 130in, 126in, 134in, 100in, 167in, and so on. If you don't get any of these then you probably will try it yourself so you can see what you got and see where everyone else went wrong.

People ask for advice so they don't seem like they are absolutely stupid and they are incorrect all the time. Advice is asked for when, asking out a girl, making food, playing a sport, mowing the lawn, etc. Advice is important because it helps people understand where they went wrong and how they can prevent someone else from going wrong.

Instead of just asking one person sometimes, people ask multiple people to get their thoughts on that issue. People will still ask one person, based on how beneficiary that is towards them and finding that decision.",0
"There is no one answer to the question of whether or not famous people are treated unfairly by the media. Some people may feel that celebrities are unfairly targeted by the media and should be given more privacy, while others may feel that this is the price of their fame. Ultimately, this is a personal decision that each individual must make.

There are a number of reasons why people might feel that celebrities are treated unfairly by the media. One reason is that the media often focuses on the negative aspects of celebrities' lives, rather than the positive. For example, the media may report on a celebrity's divorce or financial troubles, rather than their accomplishments. This can be frustrating for celebrities, who often feel that they are being judged unfairly.

Another reason why people might feel that celebrities are treated unfairly by the media is that the media often publishes private information about celebrities without their consent. This can be embarrassing or damaging to celebrities, and it can be difficult for them to rebuild their privacy once it has been violated.

Despite these valid concerns, there are also a number of reasons why people might feel that celebrities are treated fairly by the media. One reason is that celebrities often choose to be in the public eye, and they understand that they will be subject to scrutiny. Additionally, the media often reports on positive news stories about celebrities, such as their charitable work or accomplishments.

Another reason why people might feel that celebrities are treated fairly by the media is that the media often provides a platform for celebrities to share their thoughts and opinions. This can be beneficial for both the celebrities and the public, as it allows the public to learn more about the celebrities' thoughts and beliefs.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to believe that celebrities are treated unfairly by the media is a personal one. Some people may feel that the media is unfair to celebrities, while others may feel that the media is fair. Each individual must decide what they believe based on their own personal experiences and beliefs.

"I am a scientist at NASA my name is Jeff. There is a face on mars and people think its by aliens well I know its not by aliens. It is just a natural landform on mars its nothing big it wasnt made by aliens and a lot of people think its by aliens and then a lot of people agree with me also.

This face on mars is a natural landform anything can happen on a planet that we have'nt been on yet. We do not know what this planet is capble of and whats on the planet of mars. Well I think that it wasnt made by aliens becuase it gets more noticable by the years pass then it dissappers in a different year. Well Im sure our planet looks different from space in different years.

Why would aliens even want to put a face on the planet. Im sure if there was aliens on mars they would'nt be carving a face on there own planet. Im sure there living there life on mars not knowing we even exsit thats if there is aliens on there. They wouldnt what anything with us if they did I think they would have made more signs then just two dots and a straight line and they would have made the face more noticable and it dissapears after a couple of years that is probbaly of there is wind or something that might have blew away they face. We had our best people look into it and they think its a landform to they got pictures and eveidence that its just a regular landform!",0
"Have you ever been in school and your teacher tells you to come after school to get your work done? Well i think that having after school clubs is good because it can help us in school. It will help then get they work done faster, and also better for them to understand. Sometimes kids at home dont like to do they homework but if they do activities after school they would actually want to do the work so they can do the activitties.

To begin with kids get bored of just sitting there doing homework but if their actually doing activitties they would'nt be bored and actually work on they homework. If the kids are active and are having fun they would get things done faster and easier like say a student was gonna pay sports and you tell him he has to finish they homework in order to play if the kid loves the sport he would do it. nowadays kids like to do they work in activitties such as math games, card games, and many more. The teachers can explain the work better for them so they can understand and learn it better.

To continue you must show them that the work is very important, and the kids would actualy take it seriously and they could actually improve there grade. Kids nowadays don't really be trying to take things serious so the adults got to push them and show them that there homework is important and has a big impact on your grade. Its better to have someone constantly on your back because it will help you in the future it's always good to have people push you to succeed. A lot of kids give up in school and don't be wanting to do they homework thats why when soembody is doing activitties and learning they wouldn't give up on they selfs that easy on they selfs. the students also get bored of being in a quiet room just working on they work students like to be active not just sitting in one place bored.

Last but not least you got to put effort in the work to be able to understand it and to get it done or if not you would be having a very rough time on your assighnment. But always remember never give up and keep pushing for your goal because not only in school will you be stressing. Lastly these are some of the reasons why I think it would be a good idea for our schools to have afterschool activities it will help a lot.  ",0
"~Aesop said: ""

No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. ""

Examples of kindness:

Opening a door.

Giving compliments.

Helping someone with bag's.

asking about their day.

Impact on other people:

The impact on other people can be so important that even can save lives! and example of that can be that if you notice someone that is passing trough bad moments but you doun't know how to help the simple act of kindness of asking ""how is your day?"" can actually help that person by knowing that someone cares about him/her. Other ways that the small act's of kindness can change things is by making a person do good things for others. For example, if you help someone with bags, they will see how that little help makes them feel, that will make them do it for someone else or even back to you. The hole point of this is to make people know the importance of doing little act's of kindness and to show how you can do it. ",0
"I think that limiting car usage is great for the environment. There are a lot of benefits that come from it. If we use car less then greenhouse gas emissions will decrease and thus cleaning the air of smog. Some of the benefits that limiting car use is that: 1. it decreases poisonous smog, 2. lots of cities in the world are doing it, 3. and last but not least it could promote other ways of travel. Its about time that the world start changing some harmful habits.

To start of, Reducing car use is very effective when trying to get rid of smog. In some cities such as Paris, smog is a big pollution there. In Paris they even went head to head with Beijing,China which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of this globally known city. by enforcing this, some days cars with even numbered license plate could drive. The next day odd numbered cars could drive. If you were caught then you were fined. so by paris doing this congestion was down a whopping 60% in Paris after just 5 days.

This would cut down greenhouse effects tremendously. So far reducing car use sounds pretty good.

Furthermore Paris isnt the only place in the world to do this. Bogota,Colombia in a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians either hiked, bike, skated, or took a bus to commute around the country to their destination. This is known as a car free day. This carfree day left the streets of the capitol void and empty of rush hour traffic. Even the U.S. government is considering the international event that is also helping the environment at the same time.

Another thing to reduce greenhouse gas is if people would find a more alternative way of transportation. City buses could count as an alternative,because think if a bus could seat 30 people. Think if all 30 people had their own car, then the emission amout would substantialy increase 30 vehicles rather than 1 vehicle. Other ways of transportation are things such as bikes, skatesskateboard, or just walking. none of those alternatives release any type of emissions.

In a way not using cars sounds great in many ways,but there are those people out there that rely on the usage of cars to transport themselves such as anyone with physical handicaps. Maybe this is the start of something new but what happens to this earth is all on us so it what we dicide to do with it rather we wont it to last or we can just let it go and lose the one planet we have left.",0
"Had the technology a negative or positive effects on people's lives? People are having a negative effects with the technology, I think people can't control it. At this time everybody are forgeting how beutiful is lives with out technology. We can do alot of things with out it. For example: Play outside with friends, go to libraries, and stay outside with natural. Some people say the kids have to have limitation of what they doing on they computer or cells phones. On the other side people say that is good for teenager having not limitation because they can learn more. I think teenager need a limitation of what they doing in the phones. Furthermore parents should cheking what they doing in the internet.

However, some people think is good for teenager not having a limitation because they learn more for their future. On the other hand some people say that that tenenager can't complete a taskd with out having contact with other person. I thinbk having a conversition with other is good because you get to know that person and also get stronger the relationship. When you meet a strager in the internet is dangeous, not everyone is a good person. Some parents think that the kids are just playing in the internets but they do not. I think having a conversiation to you or playing games without speaking I think that have a limitation until you know well that person.

In addition, sometimes people used to buy alot of things from the internet without knowing that person, that is dangerous. People that are seeling on wedsides that always offer what the really have or maybe they just want the money. If you going to buy anything for the internet just make sure the wedside is safes. Buying staff for the internet is getting wrong because people do not want to go aout and spend time with family. Since wedsides liike Amazon, Ebay, and others came up people atart get all they need from wedside. Bad people are used this on favor to them, they are creating so many fake wedsides to racket people.

To continue with, I think a good way to get the kid out the technology is take them to have fun outside like hand out with friends, having friends in a computer like into a videogame or a social media is not healty for the kids. You have to get to know the person before play or talk to them. Sometimes people trick the kids ask them to do bad things.

That why technology shoul not be allow for kid at all or if parents decide to give a cells phone or a computer always have to be a limitation.

Technology does not aloww people to complete task with out haave a contact with others. I think this is having a negative effects on people lives, people are getting racket because they used to maney wedsides. Wedsides are not save you have to have a limitation and also take care of the like. Kid are also getting into the technology they are losing their childhooh. Furthermore parents have to a limitation on their kids and put a limit on them.",0
"You are in a relationship with a boy named Generic_Name and everything is going well. You are also best friends with a girl named Generic_Name, who starts to become jelous becuase of how much time you are spending with Generic_Name, so she tells you to make choice him or me. now you have two choices to make eithier to stay with Generic_Name or go with Generic_Name you do not know what to do so you ask for advice from friends, family and neighbors and they tell you something diffrent but you are happy because now you have diffrent opptions to choose from than the ones you had in mind.

When people need advice they should talk to more than one person because they might get a better alterniative choice than what they had before, or they could see what their neighbors,friends and family would do in your situation, or they might give you great tips that you could you in the future.

The first reason people should get advice from more than one person is because you might get a better option than what they had mind, like for instance lets go back to the story ,and lets say the child was gonna tell her friend off by telling her that she was a loser and that she never liked her anyways or that she should cry herself a river and build herself a bridge and get over the fact that she spending most of her time with Generic_Name. But instead you sat her friend down and tell her that she did not mean to spend all her time with Generic_Name or you might even go out to lunch togather and talk about whatever was bothering you. Which would be a way better outcome than the first exsample.

The second reason people should get advice from more than one person is because it is better to hear what your neighbors, friends, and family would do in your situation because you might not agree with the first advice you get. For exsample lets say the child in the story asks her neighbor what she should do and they tell her to punch the girl now you may or may not agree with that but you always have your friends and family but maybe your friends tell you to leave Generic_Name your other friend and stay with Generic_Name but you do not like that choice either, so you go to your family and they tell you to do what you think is right so you think about it and you sit your friend down to talk.

the third and last reason you should get advice from more than one person is because someone might give you tips that you could use in the future. Like maybe your aunt has been through what you are going through and wants to give incouraging words like let your heart deside not your friends or you will know who is best for you. Or maybe your grandma tells you that if your friend can't be happy for you then she is not a good friend which you could use when you are older like if someone cant love you then they are not the one for you and that you will find the right person oneday maybe not right now.

Inconclusion getting more than one persons advice is best because we do not know everything and depending on only one persons advice can be quite unsettling at times so leaning on other people opioions can help a lot now we might not like what one person says but thats why we always have other peoples advice to usecso we should use all the advice that comes our way.",0
"Seeking multiple opinions when making an important decision or asking for advice is often a wise idea. Talking to more than one person allows you to get perspectives from different life experiences and viewpoints. This exposure to a variety of opinions can help provide more context and angles to consider, ultimately leading to a sounder choice.

One key benefit is that no single person will have all the answers or catch every potential issue. Different people have diverse backgrounds, strengths, and blind spots. By consulting multiple individuals, you cast a wider informational net. Something significant that one advisor overlooks may be spotted by another. Combining the insights of several trusted sources helps fill in gaps and results in a more comprehensive analysis to weigh. 

Another advantage is that getting multiple opinions prevents being unduly swayed by a biased or self-interested singular view. People can be subjective due to their personal preferences, relationships, or past experiences. Conversely, convergence between separate advisors' guidance lends credibility that a recommendation is objective and balanced. Dissenting perspectives also expose flaws or risks that any single source may downplay or miss, providing a guard against poor or short-sighted choices.

Perhaps most importantly, considering a range of viewpoints guards against making a decision for the wrong reasons. Differences in analysis and emphasis between advisors can reveal faulty or irrational logic. Their varied counseling effectively serves as a system of checks and balances, keeping personal biases, assumptions, and blind spots in check. Integrating the spectrum of counsel received helps choose options most solidly grounded in facts, feasibility and what is likely to best achieve goals and priorities. 

In summary, discussing important decisions or requests for advice with multiple trusted individuals has significant benefits. Cross-checking perspectives and pooling different life experiences and analytical skills results in more well-rounded guidance. It provides checks against personal limitations or agendas of any single source. Ultimately, factoring in a diversity of high-quality opinions leads to choices made for the right reasons and with greater confidence they will achieve what is intended.",1

Winston Churchill's famous phrase, ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" can serve as a powerful reminder that moments of failure do not have to be the end of our journey. Instead, they can be learning opportunities and stepping stones that allow us to better understand our own strength and determination, even in the face of difficult situations. Churchill's accomplishments as Prime Minister of Britain are indicative of this philosophy. Throughout his tenure, Churchill persevered in the face of numerous obstacles and setbacks, always displaying an indomitable spirit and willingness to learn from his experiences. Even in the face of criticism, Churchill continued to persevere in his pursuit of success, highlighting the importance of maintaining enthusiasm even in the face of failure. By applying Churchill's words to our everyday lives, we can be reminded that failure does not have to be a deterrent to reaching our goals.",1
"In today's world, the term ""throw-away society"" is often used to describe our modern way of life. This is because we have become accustomed to using disposable products and throwing them away without much thought. While some may argue that this is a necessary part of our modern lifestyle, I believe that it is a dangerous trend that is harming our environment and our future.

Firstly, the use of disposable products such as plastic bags, water bottles, and food containers has led to a significant increase in waste. These products are designed to be used once and then thrown away, which means that they end up in landfills or oceans, where they can take hundreds of years to decompose. This not only pollutes our environment but also harms wildlife that may mistake the plastic for food or become entangled in it.

Secondly, the production of disposable products requires a significant amount of resources and energy. For example, the production of plastic bags requires the use of oil, which is a non-renewable resource. This means that we are using up valuable resources to create products that we will only use once and then throw away.

Finally, the throw-away society mentality has led to a culture of overconsumption and waste. We are encouraged to buy more and more products, even if we don't need them, and then dispose of them when we are done. This not only harms the environment but also contributes to a culture of materialism and consumerism that is unsustainable in the long run.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have developed into a throw-away society, and this is a dangerous trend that needs to be reversed. We need to start thinking more carefully about the products we use and the impact they have on the environment. We need to reduce our consumption of disposable products and start using more sustainable alternatives. Only then can we hope to create a more sustainable future for ourselves and for future generations.

"Some people say that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Other people say that failure do not play in the pursuit of success.

Some people say that failure plays in the pursuit of succes because if we fail we learn how to stand up after every time we fall down,For thing we never had we have to do something we never did,If we fail big we learn big things,and we fail once we have to try again.

In life stuation we fail but it does not mean we never pass,Life is hard to deal with it but we can deal with it,every time we fail we have opportunity to fix it,Life is about gulliblety bad ideas come to our mind but we don't have to think about it we have to think positive,Every time we fail we think we are guilty,We think we are useless,We think we can not do it but there is somwthing in the back we have to catch it that thing is success.

We are skillful that thing is notthing against our skills,we always worried about what others think what we accomplish and what we carry out but it is our job that what we do, We have to lead our self to get success and we are the finder,there is alot of ways to pass we can get help from others:family,teachers,friends,and people;every body is liable for there own work.

Once i had biology class that i had to pass SOL I toke the SOL fourtimes at the last time i pass it,It was hard to pass SOL for me but i never stop accomplish even i hate that,In some point in our life we fail but we do not have to loss our firmness or solidity,We do not have to shrik responsibility,We have to strenghen our ideas,We ahve hopes in our life that we need to make them true,In some points in life we have to calm down take a teep breathe and focuse on our work, In a test when we fail we learn things like:what was in the test,how to use an other strategy to pass the test,how to try,and what can we use in the test like dictionary;This is how failure play in the pursuit of success.

"With the information the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" covers, this advancement in technology seems extremely unnecessary and could potentially have negative effects even with the good intentions behind it. As far as what is explained in this article the only benefit to this technology is that computers will know what you are feeling, and the question that needs to be asked is; do we really want them to? Secondly, there was no mention of how much this kind of technology costs or if it would even be plausible for it to be in a classroom setting. Lastly, why is it be necessary for a computer to overtake yet another aspect of a teacher's job of human interaction and communication. Technology being able to read emotional expressions in the classroom sounds wildly ludicrous in terms of use, cost, and personal connections

Although all seems harmless on the forefront of this idea, the side effects could turn very sour very quick. Nick D' Alto says ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" The author of this article talks of how it will improve ad placements by whether you smile or frown, however I know for a fact social medias, especially Facebook, are already basing information on preferable ads by just what material you look at. Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security.

However if this technology was to be used in a classroom, the next question is of course the cost of such a new computer process. All computers would have to have facial recognition in their system and although there is no mention of cost in the article one can imagine that this new technology is not cheap. Is it realistic to expect that schools will pay great amounts of tax payers dollars just so that we can invade the privacy of our children to figure out if they are bored? It seems much more financially sound to not steal the jobs of millions of teachers and let them get to know their students, opposed to scanning their face.

Teachers are necessary in the classroom not only to impart knowledge but also to make those personal connections that tell them how to best teach their kids. Every student is different, learns a different way and reacts differently to every aspect of the classroom. The article says a computer will be able to detect if a student is bored, but teachers have that ability already, minus the cost and invasion of privacy. Teachers are in the classroom so that they can make those personal connections with each student and ensure that they are doing everything they can to provide the best education possible. If a computer detects boredom it will just try another lesson without knowing what is best for the student. So the question that needs to be asked is why would this sort of technology be useful in the classroom?

In conclusion technology that scans your face to read your emotions has too many ethical questions, financial problems, and no personal connections for this computer process to be acceptable in the classroom. Although this advancement is impressive, the classroom setting is most definitely not the right place for this type of computer process.",0
"Our country's history with cars date back a few centuries. Today, there are many cars from different brands, with different designs, and with different benefits. Though all these cars have one thing in common they emit harmful pollution to the air. We already know that the pollutantss given off from cars have caused the greenhouse effect in the world. This has been a main topic for decades, on how to figure out how to solve and reduce the amount of pollution so that Earth can sustain us. Limiting car usage will reduce the pollutants emission from the cars, it will cause less traffic jam and congestion in parking, and some people are tend to become more relaxed and happy.

The Earth is being effected with harmful gases caused by cars. Our vehicles that we drive everyday, the one we take to work or schools or places you want to see, are the main source of pollutantss coming into the air and causing the greenhouse gases. The limited usage of cars will reduce the amount of emission given off. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, France has the most amount of smog in the European countries. This smog has caused warmer layers of air to trap car emissions will cause heat to the country. But when they have put a ban in cars for a while, the amount of smog has decreased. Furthermore, if we continue to reduce or at less limit the amount of time we spend driving or riding in the car, we can help reduce the emissions made. Rosenthal states, ""...emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" If we do not limit the use of cars now, not only will the Earth suffer, people will suffer as well. The limit usage of cars can save the Earth and ourselves.

The constant honking, switching lands, and when reached the destination, a parking is needed to be found. With the amount of cars, traffic jam and lack of parking space is evitable. Pollution also contributes to the traffic jam and congestion. Though if limited cars we used congestion will come down. According to Duffer, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" The lack of cars on the road will cause many more people to get to work or school or any place they want without rushing becaus the roads are clear. Moreover, parking space is a hassle to find when there are so many cars everywhere. With less cars means less space for parking, this could save money for the government and invest more on what the country needs. In Vauban, Germany, they had to give up their cars but on the positive side, on the main streets, stores are placed walking distance rather than on a highway Source 1. With the less amount of cars, highways and roads do not have to be invested in too much rather the money may be used to invest in other important things.

When we are younger, we dream of driving and having a bit of freeedom but when we actually start driving it gets tiring. Some people are stressed out when driving and tend to be very prone to accidents. Though when just taking a bicycle or walking it relieves stress. Carlos Arturo Plaza states in the article ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Stress will only increase when we get older, taking off a load of stress by limiting the usage of cars can be a breather for all of us. Also, people are happy when they do not need cars. Heirdrun Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, Rosenthal"" When Heirdrum means ""this way"", she is referring to not using a car to get to places. A person should be happy rather than angry and rage because when in a car, some people may do things that could hurt them.

Roads and highways are always being invested because of the increase in car users. If we continue this in the future, there might not be a bright future if we do not stop it. The limit of using cars can cause less pollution in our air, get people to places faster, and make a person smile. This may lead some down fall into the economy and for the employees but with the increase of other alternative to get to places this can lead into a boom in the economy. The positives out run the negatives in this topic. If cars are limited, parks and sports centers will bloom uneven, pitted sidewalks will be fixed to smooth sidewalks rushhour will be cut traffic and food places and stores will increase. Even the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company proposed ""parternering with the telecommunications inductry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transprtation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety'"" Source 4. In the end, it is up to decide if we would rather continue using cars or not. So go and choose the side that will benefit not only the economy or government but the people and environment.",0
"Are cars beginning to go out of fashion? Over the last few years, fewer and fewer people are getting their driver's liscense, and less people are buying cars. That's because walking or taking public transportation where you need to go can be more beneficial than driving. Using alternative transportation decreases stress, lowers air pollution, and eliminates the cost of owning a car. These reasons are causing people to eliminate personal vehicles out of their lives.

To begin, using alternative transportation can lower stress. Millions of people around the world face the same problem every morning and afternoon: traffic. Traffic jams cause people to be late for work, causing their stress levels to go up. Stress can lead people into depression or become tense. Eliminating a car from someone's life can allow them to be happy. Instead of driving, many people are starting to walk to work, or take a public bus to where they need to go. If more people begin to stop driving, the roads will be less jammed, which will lower road congestion, leading to less stress. Getting rid of your car can be a key element to eliminating stress.

Second, walking or taking a bus lowers air pollution. In France, air pollution was so bad, the government set a one-day ban on driving motorvehicles. Instead, residents could take public busses free of charge, or walk. Anyone who decided to drive their vehicle on the day they were banned, faced a $31 fine. Another city in Colombia also started a similar campaign. Government officials in Bogota, Colombia set a one day ban in the city called ""the Day Without Cars"". The turnout was large, people rode busses, rode bikes, or walked to wherever they needed to go. This eliminated traffic james, and lowered air pollution. Violaters of the ban had to pay a $25 fine. Other countries surely will soon do the same thing.

Lastly, the cost to own a car is far too expensive. Buying a car leads to many problems. the cost of paying off your car after you buy it can overwhelm many people. Having to pay hundreds of dollars every month to repair your car or pay for gas can lead you into debt. Many individuals have become homeless because they can't afford to pay for the things they need, such as a car. Without a car, you save thousands of dollars you can use to pay off other things you might owe.

To conclude, using alternative transportation instead of a car can be very beneficial. It lowers stress, eliminates air pollution, and eliminates the expenses of a car. More and more people are beginning to outlaw cars from their lives, and it is helping the world as well as themselves.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage can help in many ways. Limiting cars usage can help gobal warning, traffic, even help families. Cars help us tranport our self or things to places  but the problems that come with having a car, can be stressful.

According to the Article Car-free day in spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Bogota, Colombia is trying to spread its Car Free program to other countries. The Colombia Car Free has help business people relied their stress and help lower the air pollution. The Bogota program promote people to hike, bike, skate or take a buses to work during the Car-Free day. The results from the Car-free day had dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have increased. This shift in driving cars had lowered in the United States. According to the The End of Car Culture, Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. This mean that more citizens are using public tranportation more then driving their Mobile vehicle. This is woven to a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety, according to Chairman of Ford Motor Company. The results are that there are less pollution in the air because of citizens not wanting a vehicle or licenses.

The limiting of car usage is really working. That citizens in different countries are happy with the results of the Car-free day. Its not just help the Countries it helping the people that live in thoses countries.",0
"Venus is one of the brightest stars in the solar system and is consitered to be the ""second sun"". It is almost as dense as earth and is said to be called ""earths twin"". The planet has been studied very closely even though we are miles and miles away. The planet is almost impossible to land on. Every spaceship that has landed has crashed or dissapeared. The atmosphere is so dense taking a regular iphone there would melt entering each layer of the atmophere.

The most challenging point to venus is it's atmospheric pressure which is ninety times greater then earth and has the ground tempurature eight hundred degrees fairenheit. Scientists have seeen many volcanos and lightning outbursts very close in intrevals of time on Venus which can make landing and space travel difficult. NASA says orbiting, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" Which means the ground would ""liquify metal"".

Since Venus is one of the closest planets we could possibly travel too. NASA has been experimenting and planning. NASA has been planning to bring back the mechanical computer from World War Two, to bring into space because of its dense steel and metals. Some may contemplate Venus is just a rock planet and empty.

"Older and younger students are different. Older studentss are smarter then the younger because younger student hasn't been teach alot like the older students on any subjects. Students have different ages then others. Teacher teaches different students becuase of their age. Other student have different grade then young students.

First, yong students are late born then older student. Their parent might atempt their student early or late to school. Young students needs alot of stuff to be teach. Some studednt might be smart or intelligant then other. It depends on their skills of listening and reading. If they do well on listening or reading or others, they will gete smarter.

Second, when the young students gets older, their starting to change and turning into a teenager. Student also start growing like the other older students. When the students gets older, they will have a deploma paper like other studetns will get. Students starts at a different subject then others.

Most likely, olderer students are brilliant then the younger students. They're are available to any program with other students. The older students studys alot then the younger because they get prepare for any test their gonna take. Students also goes to many program when teachers assign them to go, and get important details about that program.

Finally, older and younger students are most likely different comparing to each other. Their both have different reading, writing, and speaking skills. The most important thing about older and younger student is that the older studentes like to help the younger students. What they have in common is that they read and work hard alot each day they go to school. Older and younger students are pair because that's how the law was made.",0
"There is no one answer to the question of whether work is more stressful today than in the past. Some people might say that work is more stressful because there is more pressure to produce and to be constantly connected to work via technology. Others might say that work is less stressful because there are more options for flexible work arrangements.

I believe that work is both more and less stressful than in the past. On the one hand, technology has created a constant demand for connectivity and productivity. This can lead to a lot of stress for people who feel like they need to be constantly working. On the other hand, technology has also created more opportunities for flexible work arrangements. This can be really helpful for people who want to have more work-life balance.

Overall, I think that work is more stressful for some people and less stressful for others. It really depends on the individual and the specific work situation. I think that it is important to be aware of the potential stressors in your work life, and to take steps to manage them. For example, you can try to set realistic goals for yourself, and take breaks to relax and rejuvenate.

"THere has been quite a lot of recent talk of whichh the national government should keep the Electoral COllege, or change to an election by popular vote for the president of the UNited states. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress""Source 1: What is the Electoral College? by the office of the federal register. IT has been established by the founding fathers to make a compromise between popular vote and election vote in congress. Popular representation is a vote for qualified citizens to take an individual vote cast to the state whichh then is transferred to a representative whole. the are many good effects this popular representation has on the country, but the senator should keep the Electoral College without a shout of a doubt.

one of the most important reasons we should keep the electoral college process is that in this process, states pay much more attention to the electors due to having swing states. the people who decide on our president should be most intrigued and the most concerning ones. ""voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that theu are going to decide the electionin defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president, by richard a. posner, subtitle Swing States"". MAny voters that are in swing states, whichh are stated that cast the majority of votes in the system with higher amounts of population, therefore congress representatives.

another reason why the gov should keep the electoral college is because it resorts unwanted balance. ""there is no pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes casy that pressure whichh would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, whichh invariably produces a clear winner"" so what this quote from the passage is saying is that no candidate recieves a majority if the votes cast, due to each states fair rep of the population without being overwhelmed by the most populated states such as florida, california, and texas. While you may believe that the popular representation vote may be overwhelmingly more accurate to the people wants , you are wrong. the electoral college is a process in which hgives the people wants in a state to an elector who then gives you an equal chance one voting for what you pleased. he may be the ""biggest"" or ""smallest"" amount of electoral votes, but as a state in a whole yu may recieve a big surprise that there is no clear winner as each president may not be just familiat with one region such as the north east, or the southwest, etc.

so as you can see, the government should keep an electoral colllge process instead of the popular representation vote. it would be greatly appreciated to the United States People who may be under informed of how grest an opportunity for an idea such as this to vote up, or they might be over informed of fallacy information of our election process now.",0
"The world is full of amazing and wondrous sights, but perhaps none more so than the Great Barrier Reef. Located off the coast of Australia, this natural wonder stretches for over 1,400 miles and is home to an incredible array of marine life. From sea turtles to coral reefs, sharks to dolphins, its beauty can be seen in a variety of ways both above and below the water’s surface. More than just an impressive visual spectacle, however, the Great Barrier Reef offers visitors many unique opportunities. For example, snorkeling or scuba diving are popular activities amongst tourists who wish to explore this remarkable environment up close and personal. In fact there are several companies that offer guided tours along with rental equipment such as masks and fins so novices can easily participate even without any prior experience. Additionally kayaking trips are also available which allow individuals to paddle through shallow waters near shorelines while noticing different species of flora and fauna living close by. Though it may not always be obvious at first glance, protecting these habitats from human-caused harm is essential if we want them preserved for future generations. To that end various conservation efforts have been taken on by multiple organizations in order ensure that threats like industrial pollution or climate change do not negatively impact these ecosystems too severely over time. More recently artificial coral reefs have been constructed throughout parts of the reef where damage has already occurred in order repopulate areas with healthy corals once more; this will help speed up recovery processes naturally occurring within our oceans today as well give researchers better insight into how they can continue challenging effects brought about by humans elsewhere around globe too!. In conclusion then it's clear why people often refer to the Great Barrier Reef as one of Earth’s precious wonders—it's certainly a sight worth seeing when visiting Australia! Not only does its beautiful scenery provide travelers with memories that will last lifetime but also helps protect vulnerable animal species from further danger due various conservation projects taking

"Limiting car usage has many advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. Additionally, limiting car usage can promote more sustainable and efficient transportation options, such as public transportation and cycling. Finally, reducing car dependence can lead to healthier and more active lifestyles for individuals. These advantages make it clear that limiting car usage is a positive step towards a more sustainable and livable future.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, and by decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint. The passage set states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can make progress towards achieving greenhouse gas reduction goals and mitigating the effects of climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. Cars emit pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which can have detrimental effects on human health. The passage set mentions that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and improved air quality. By limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier environments for ourselves and future generations.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote more sustainable and efficient transportation options. The passage set describes an experimental community in Germany called Vauban, where car ownership is limited and public transportation and cycling are prioritized. Similarly, the passage set mentions a car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, which aimed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. By investing in public transportation infrastructure and prioritizing walking, cycling, and public transit, we can create more accessible and sustainable cities that are less dependent on cars.

Lastly, limiting car usage can lead to healthier and more active lifestyles for individuals. The passage set mentions that some residents of Vauban, Germany, feel happier and less stressed without cars. By reducing car usage, people are encouraged to walk or cycle more, leading to increased physical activity and improved health. Additionally, by investing in walkable neighborhoods and improving pedestrian infrastructure, we can create environments that are conducive to active lifestyles.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, promote sustainable transportation options, and encourage healthier and more active lifestyles. By prioritizing alternatives to cars and investing in sustainable transportation infrastructure, we can create more livable and environmentally friendly cities. The benefits of limiting car usage make it clear that it is a necessary step towards a more sustainable and prosperous future.",1
"The limiting of personalcar usage has done wonders for the areas that this policy has be implemented. Strictly enviermentaly speaking in the cites that have limited their residents personal car usage the smog rates went drasicly down. Thoughschanges happened in a matter of days. Imagin the changes that could accoure if limited car usage was implemented on a wider scale for the long term. Not only envirermentaly beneficial but limited car usage also has large and far reaching economic and social upsides. The lack of money being waisted on personal automobeal transportation leads to a surplus of savings for everyday familes to spend or more nessary items. Socialy limited car usage has be proven to be benifal as a whole also. People living in areas that have already been placed under this polices report significant reductions in stress and worrying, leading to much weight off their sholders and a general better aqttude over all.

The first and most obvious advantage of the limed car usage policiy is the massive positive impact the police has the earth. As stated in source one and I quote ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."". Now imagin if thoes percentages just went away. In the city of Vauban Germany, an experimental city already under the policy, it did. Another example if Paris. A city that literly had to force the policy of limited car usage apon it people in a desperate attempt to reverse what the evils of personal car usage was doing to the atmosphere of the city. The personal cars created smog so think the city hit record pollution levels that even rivaled Beijing its self, one of the worlds most poluted citys. As stated in source two, the city put a ban on cars with any license plates that were even numbered on the first day from driving and a ban on odd numbered the second day. The positives of the limited car usage plicy was so instantaneous that the second day of no driving for odd numbered cars was deamed not nessary. The massive environmental advantages of the limited car usage policiy can neiter be denyed or ignored.

The economic advantages of this policy can also not be ignored. To fully grasp the economic upswing that will accure under this policy we must turn our attention the the great city of Bogota, Colombia. In this former Spanish colony turned capital city a program has been set up called the ""carfree day"". On this day no cars are driven and a festable is set up to promote alternate transportaion and reduce smog. This year two other Colombian citys, Cali and Valledupar joned the event citing the obouse advantages of the policy. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" says buisinessman Carlos Arturo Plaza source 3 quotes. The policy as done economic wonders not only for the people but for the city its self. since the day begin in the mid 1990s over 118 miles of bike path have been created, parksand sports centers have bloomed throughout the city, uneven sidke walks have been leveled out, and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up as reported by source 3. The limited car usage policy cound be the merical policy for citys in need of an economic boost.

Finaly the social advantages of the policy have also been noted.

The evils of the modern day car culture must be destroyed. As said by Carlos Plaza preveously ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"". ""When i had a car I was always tense. Im mush happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter resident of Vauban. Two people on two totaly differnt sides of the world both experenced the social advantages of this policy. Even young people are seeing the advantages according to a study last year that found that driving by young people devreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 according to source 4.

As one can now clearly see the advantages of limted personal car usage are impossibkle to deny and even harder to ignore. Economicly,socialy, and enviromentaly this policy as done wonders where ever it has been implimented. It has both immeadit and long term positive effects with no odveous negitive effects. Altrnates to personal cars could be things like Bill fords bisiness plan for a world in which personal vehical ownership is replaced witha partnering with the telecommunications industy to create citys in which pedestrians, bicycle, private cars, and public and commerical traffic are woven into a connected netword. The acceptence of limited car usage and the extenciton of modern day car culture is the next step for the advacment of humanity.",0

"I believe that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are many reasons for this. One reason is that advertisements are designed to create a desired impression in the minds of consumers. This is done by creating a mental image of the product that is better than what people actually experience. For example, when people see an ad for a new car, they may expect the car to be much faster and more luxurious than what they actually get. Another reason is that advertisements often use exaggerated or unrealistic images to make their points. This makes it easier for people to understand the product and to form an opinion about it. For example, an advertisement for a new car may show a model of the car being driven around a track. However, the model in the ad is often much larger and faster than what people can actually buy. This makes the car seem much more impressive and desirable. Overall, I believe that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. This is done to create a desired impression in the minds of consumers and to make it easier for them to understand the product.

"There are a few reasons why it is better to have broad knowledge of many different academic subjects. First, this allows you to gain a more complete understanding of the world around you, and to better cope with the challenges of life. Second, this allows you to cultivate an awareness of the connections between different knowledge and disciplines, and to better understand the ways in which they can be applied to your own life. Third, by having a broad knowledge base, you are less likely to become bogged down in detail and focused on a specific topic. This allows you to explore new perspectives and to develop new skills, which can benefit your personal and professional life.

"TEXTING AND DRIVING

""In a split second you could ruin your future, injure or kill others, and tear a hole in the heart of everyone who loves you"", said by the mother of a texting while driving victim. The majority of people today use a smart phone on a daily basis. While cellphones have their pros and cons, there is one controversial issue that seems to triumph over the rest, and that is using a cell phone while driving. Operating a cell phone while driving can be extremely hazardous. By following the law and removing phones from behind the wheel, we can eliminate a monumental amount of deaths worldwide.

While some people really can multitask with a phone while operating a vehicle, everyone is not capable of this. Texting and driving is against the law for a reason. This law was put in place to protect us humans from traumatic car accidents.

Some may argue that it's okay to text & drive if you have a self driving car (Requires minimal driver's assistance) but numbers don't lie. According to the NHTSA, there was a Tesla fatality every 86 million miles in 2017, which is 40,000 deaths. Now imagine the amount of accidents in cars that don't drive themselves. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year.

Now all of these accidents can be eliminated if we as humans just put away their cell phones while behind the wheel. Whatever is being done on one's phone can't wait. A text message is not worth a life.",0
"Are you ever in that one situation where you have to make a difficult decision and you don't know which option is the right one? Seeking advice from others is one of the best ways a person can make a mindful decision. Advice from others can do this by giving different approaches to a problem, relieving stress, and prepare a person for other future choices as well as motivating others. In addition, it's entirely free!

Most people who are involved in making important decisions usually do not call on others for help and are statistically proven to make choices that they later regret. This is mainly due to the fact that people who only listen to their own advice often lack perspective. Perspective from others can help give the decision maker more options and give a clearer view of which decisions are not the best to make. To no surprise, advice from others is the best way a person can use those viewpoints to their advantage. Not only do more options open up to the decision maker but they will also have enough evidence or support to lead to their final decision. Eighty-Nine percent of people who took the advice from peers or friends and looked at a situation in a different viewpoint than their own arrived at a better decision than those who listened to only themselves. Thus, advice from others can lead to more beneficial viewpoints than the advice from one's self.

Majority of the time, the decision maker will stress more and more the longer they try to think of the best choice to make. This is especially true to adolescents when they are a few years away from adulthood. However, relieving this stress has no simpler solution than from the helpful words of fellow advisers. Those who give the advice won't usually understand the stress the decision maker is going through which is why most of the time their advice can be all the more relieving to the decision maker. Just like stress, calmness can also build up within a person which results in smarter final decisions, not the stressful and thoughtless ones. The loss of stress can also find people working more efficiently and calmly. Although, a person can feel the stress within them, they usually intend to ignore it and don't realize the negative impact it has on their decision making. Others could easily notice this and would address this with practical but relieving advice so that the decider may focus on work rather than their conflicting emotions.

Advice from others doesn't necessarily mean it's for one decision. It can be used for future ones and even inspire a decision maker to give it to another. Statistics show that ninety-one percent of those who received advice from others applied it regularly for other problems. Of those nine-one percent of people, around eighty-percent of them shared it with others. These statistics are groundbreaking and show the vast benefits multiple opinions can have on someone. Not only that but advice from others can get people out of the habit of having a closed mindset and offer them new opportunities. From the beginning advice from others has played a big role in shaping the present and will continue to do so for the future. This is only possible however, if people are willing to be less stubborn and listen to others for a change rather than only themselves.

In conclusion the points from above show that advice from other provides many benefits and opportunities which can lead to better decision making. By looking at a different perspective they can identify the most beneficial decisions. Advice from others also relieves the decision maker of the traumatizing stress that builds up within them. Finally, others' advice can help you and others make better future decisions. Remember, the greatest gift from your friends is the influence and advice they have.",0
"In today's highly competitive job market, obtaining a degree certificate has become increasingly important. However, there is growing concern that focusing solely on academic achievements can lead to a narrow view of success. While a degree certificate may open the door to certain opportunities, it does not necessarily reflect one's overall abilities and skillset. In this essay, I will argue that while degree certificates are important, they should not be the sole measure of success.

Firstly, a degree certificate only reflects a person's academic achievements, which may not be indicative of their overall abilities. For instance, a person who has a degree in mathematics may be highly intelligent in that subject but may lack other essential skills such as communication, teamwork, or leadership. In contrast, a person who has not obtained a degree but has gained real-world experience may have a broader range of skills and knowledge that are highly valued by employers. Therefore, it is unfair to judge a person solely based on their academic achievements.

Secondly, the job market is constantly evolving, and the skills required for success are continually changing. A degree certificate may be essential in some fields, but it may not be relevant in others. Moreover, some skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and adaptability cannot be taught in a classroom but are essential for success in today's job market. Therefore, it is important to recognize that a degree certificate is not the only measure of success and should not be the primary factor when making hiring decisions.

Lastly, it is essential to promote diversity in the workplace. Focusing solely on degree certificates may limit diversity as it may exclude talented individuals who have not had the opportunity to obtain a degree. In contrast, considering a person's overall abilities and skills can lead to a more diverse and inclusive workforce.

In conclusion, while degree certificates are important, they should not be the sole measure of success. It is essential to consider a person's overall abilities and skills when making hiring decisions. Additionally, it is important to recognize that the job market is constantly changing, and the skills required for success are continually evolving. Therefore, focusing solely on academic achievements may limit diversity and exclude talented individuals.

"When it comes to the topic of sustainable development, few people consider how our daily habits can have a significant impact on helping us achieve global sustainability. As individuals, we may feel that there is little we can do to make a difference but the truth is that small changes in our everyday lives can have positive repercussions for future generations. One such example is by simply reducing our use of plastic and single-use items - an incredibly easy step to take that has large scale impacts. Plastic waste contributes significantly towards the amount of pollution found within our environment, with 8 million metric tons ending up in the ocean every year according to The Guardian (2018). By replacing single-use items with reusable ones such as coffee cups or water bottles, both money and resources are saved while also reducing plastic waste production. Not only this but these new resources are then diverted from potential harmful activities and instead used toward more meaningful projects related to education or medical research which furthers progress towards global sustainability. In addition to considering what materials you buy for your own personal usage, one could also think about how their buying habits could benefit others too; something known as conscious consumerism whereby all aspects surrounding an item’s production process are taken into account when making purchasing decisions (Good On You 2019). This includes understanding where a product was made and what conditions its workers were living under during its manufacturing process – ensuring no unethical practices such as child labour were involved in order for it be produced. Inevitably this requires some research beforehand yet knowing exactly where your products come from allows you not only ensure ethical practices have been followed but also support local businesses wherever possible through fair-trade initiatives among other things which helps promote economic growth across communities while simultaneously aiding global sustainability efforts too. Overall it should be clear just how much influence each person has over their consumption patterns regardless of whether they realise it or not - even very little actions like using reusable grocery bags when shopping at supermarkets can help contribute positively towards

"I think facial action coding system should'nt be used in the classroom to read students emotions. most students wouldnt want there there emotions being read its like envading privacy of ones thoughts and of course emotion.

Dr. Huang says that in the classroom the FACS could determine ones emotion of being confused or bored,but wouldnt it also try to read other emotions as well? Thats not exactly fair to the students. You couldnt rely on it working right anyway. If a student is actually upset they could put a smile on ther face and the conmputer would read it as happy.

Another claim what if students refuse to go to school because of the FACS what is the studet wants to be left alone and the teacher could start critizing them for not paying attention or being distracted or bored. That wouldnt exactly help anything for the student emotionally. Although he/she maybe bored or depressed and not really paying attention they could just be having a bad day or week,and FACS is envading there emotions.

I think that FACS should not be used in the classroom but ore like for military purposes. Or they could be used in police investigations, not for stdents in the classroom. If students are confused they should be the ones to make up there mind and ask questions.",0
"Why should people who be qualified be only able to vote? Voting should be for everyone, not such as anyone like as in Gang related people or people who are in prison but you get the point.

They way certaint people, like me, see things like if the One out of the other person who is running for President and his votes come back with such little insufficient votes like 87% to 89.5% the should continue the vote and the show must continue! Even though the ''Electoral College'' seems like just a waste of time, does it even work?

Making mona lisa smile agian was the main topic detail in the story. For one reason it would have to be when they painted a picture of her for acomplishing the process of the model of a great model she smiled for that picture. So that is why that gave her own picture of herself and the computer model picture is a little bit better than the orignal one. The computer model has better details in the picture and it also tightens her lips for the picture. More reason is that they express the emotion of her picture in paragraph 2. In paragraph 7 the experts for the picture tell Mona Lisa how to pose for the picture in the first sentence. Paragraph 8 explains Mona being truthful and smiling in the last sentence. Inside Paragraph 4 it is telling about how the expression of the real face is inside the art of Mona Lisa.,0
"By reading this article I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a great way to choose our next president or Vice president.

"Current day, almost everyone owns a cell phone. When using a cell phone, you are easily distracted. For instance, say you are on vacation and you were looking for a restaurant on your phone and fell in the water. But, if you're easily distracted while walking, imagine how much more distracting you'd be in a car. There's a right time for your phone, the car is not one.

When you're driving, you not only have to be aware of yourself, but your surroundings. Including construction, other drivers, and pedestrians. Already as a driver it's hard to stay focused when you have passengers and/or playing music. Now picture you're driving down the road and see a man on his phone hit a kid on a bike and speed off afterwards. There are many safety hazards while driving and adding a phone into the equation, only adds more. Georgia has just now recently added the ""Hands Free"" rule to where it's illegal to be on your phone as you're driving. There are over 1.5 million car crashes a year caused from phones and over 385,000 injuries a year. So, the no phone rule is very a good addition and one of the best laws I've ever heard of.

On the other hand, some people argue that it shouldn't be a rule. They give pointless points like GPS, or ""Important Phone Calls"". There are easy fixes to these. If you are worried about getting an important call, connect your phone to your Bluetooth on your car. If your car doesn't have Bluetooth, whenever someone calls, you could just put it on speaker. For the GPS part, all you have to do it get a device that'll hold your phone for you. It allows you to see any calls, messages, or the GPS. There are many fixes for why not to have this law, but no good reason on why it shouldn't be a law.

In conclusion, drivers should not be allowed to hold their phone personally in their hand while driving. If that means zero access in some places, then so be it. It's not worth someone losing their life because you wanted to text someone back or talk to your significant other. But, if have a device that holds it for you is allowed, that they be a win-win for everyone. There's a right time for your phone, the car is not one.",0
"Asking for more gets you more. If you ask for advice than you need more than one mind . For example If you work together you can get what you seek for. Asking for advice has more wisdom in it, and the more information the better the advice. Without asking you can not get a lot of things done in life. There are so many ways to get what you want the more you put effort in the better the results will be.

To add on to get the best advice you need to work together and because of that you can get the wisest and smartest advice. Working together gets a lot of things accomplished you can learn a lot form each other and your group can fix your mistakes. Working together is more effect than working by your self, because some people have more wisdom or some people are smarter and all combine you can get the best advice. Seeking for advice from people is like reading books the more books you read the more knowledge you get. If you do not ask people or work together than you will be lost in life for example when you go some were new and if you are lost you can ask people were the directions are. Thats the same thing with asking others for advice.

Also one thing is that wisdom can make a lot of things better in life. It can help you with more than you wish for, another thing is that the more wisdom the better the results will be. Asking people for advice can give you a lot of wisdom and the more you ask the more your advice will be. Wisdom is a key in life just by saying a couple of words can give a lot of influences thats why its important to talk to others so the advice they give to you can be better than the one you made.

Another thing is without information you can not get simple things done in life, but with a lot of information than you can get a lot of things done in life. Talking to more than one person is better, the reason why is because you are seeking advice and you are also getting more information. With a lot of information the advice will become better because than the advice will have some knowledge in it. When you do something wrong and you can fix it and then you will learn from it which will get you information. Same thing with people all over the world they make mistakes and they fix it. So in conclusion the people who have done a lot of things in there lives are the smartest ones with the best advice to give out. One thing is that books and humans are similar. You can't know the information without opening the book or talking to the person, sometimes it might be good or it might be horrible, but the more you go through the more infromation/advices you will get.

To sum it all up talking to more than one person is better than doing it alone. The more people the more knowledge the more knowledge the more wisdom. Talking to more than one person is helpful when you are stuck on something you can ask others for help or when you are buying something you can ask others which one is the best choice and then you can learn from that person. Having wisdom in life helps a lot, and to have wisdom you must have information from others by asking. I believe that asking more than one person can be really helpful in life you can learn a lot from it and get to know more people and asking is a cycle of life you will end up helping someone like you in the future.",0
"I think that drivers should not be able to operate while on the road because they can get easily distracted, they don't pay attention and could crash, they can fatally harm the people on the road. There have been a lot of different accidents because of people working on the road on their phone, or just not doing their jobs right from the start.

Drivers get easily distracted when using their phone to make calls for business.

According to EdgarSnyder. com the average amount of car crashes from using cell phones are about 1.6 million a year. The site also said that 94% of people support the ban for texting and driving. If drivers work on the road they are more likely to take phone calls or texts while driving, and that may result in a crash or an accident of some sort.

On average there are 1.25 million deaths yearly by automobile. With people working on the road that average is going to double faster. Being able to talk on the phone or texting while driving with more people adding everyday to work on the road the more people that work on the road the more likely there is to be an accident, and the more accidents, the higher fatality rate. People will quit their jobs to work on the road and make money, From July to September about 2.4% of people voluntarily quit their jobs. Of the 7 billion people in the world 2.4% quit their jobs and that rate will grow fast.

A lot of jobs that require working on the road like Uber, Lyft, Uber eats, Doordash, all have requirements for the job. Different companies have different ways of working, but most of the employees don't really pay attention to the rules because they think they don't need them.

For those who don't pay attention or follow the rules, they suffer the consequences. Driving is an important part of people and their jobs as they commute to work every single day. If there are any distractions that take away the commute then there should not be a lot of people working on the road.

In conclusion i think that people should not be able to work on the road. Drivers get easily distracted, they don't pay attention, they don't do their jobs. Working on the roads can get very distracting. Working on the road is very dangerous. It is very life threatening.",0
"Albert Schweitzer the philosopher,physician, and humanitarian is great at motivating people by saying, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing. What he means from that is everyone behavior is different. When it comes to behavior anybody could act different. behavior influences some people. when it comes to influence it often affects a person or events. Albert Schweitzer is a very successful man and he probably accomplished that by having influence in him self and believing on what he is capable of. Say one day i was having a rough day and somebody asks me, ""hey, do you want to know something"" or if they are being very annoying your attitude and behavior is going to change into something bad. Yes behavior could change somebody attitude and that's not good and that's what he's trying to say. Albert Schweitzer is setting good examples for people who struggle and people who really needed to hear his example.

Everything that Albert said in that quote is very true. Always setting good examples are a good and great way to influence somebody in many ways as what he just told us in his quote. Albert Schweitzer probably learned in the past and maybe thats what he's trying to tell us to watch our future that is ahead of of us in time.                           ",0
"(1)A talent I have is pranking people. Something that inspired me to do pranks on people was a

YouTube creator. He went out in public and did these prank that inspired me to try them. My first prank I did was on my family by putting a woppie cushion on they seat it was fun and it made me laugh. I started to do more pranks on them but the pranks started to get boring they were no more good ideas.

My new ideas were using the pranks in new ways. Not what they were designed to do in new creative ways like putting a cockroach under a cookie that idea went really well it scared a lot of people that was one of my creative pranks.

my second one was. It was called Valentines through the hand box. This one took a little bit more effort then the rest of them because you had to cut a big hole through the box that was the size of your hand. How this work was on Valentines I would of gave someone a big box that is the shape of a heart and cover the bottom of the box were the hand would go in and they would open it and a hand would pop out at them. this is how I started to develop to use pranks to make people laugh. I still use these pranks I buy them off

Amazon and at 5 Below. Now I .use the prank more on teachers for the most part and how I use it is is in public I place a fake poop on the ground and people got disgusted and I once had a robot cockroach made people freak out. Well I think it is important to have some pranks in our life it make us feel joy and happy afterword because how the world is now a days, they is not that much joy in life more people then ever are sad so we all need sometimes a laugh in our lives no better way to do it by a harmless prank. pranking people is my talent those are some reason why I am good at pranking people and that how I use pranking in my life.",0
"Many people think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specializw in one specific subject while other people don`t. I agree with this statement. I think it`s better for a person to know a lot about many different subjects rather than specializing in a single one. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you need to learn about medicine, biology, chemistry, physics, psychology, and many other subjects. If you only know about one or two of these subjects, then you will not be able to do well in medical school and you may end up with a lower grade than you would have otherwise. On the other hand, it would be better if someone specialized in only one of the subjects that he or she is interested in. This way, the person will have a better chance of getting a good grade in the subject and will be more likely to get a job in that field.

What is the most important thing that you learned in college? I learned that there is no such thing as a free lunch. There is always a price to pay for what you get in return for your time and effort. In other words, there will always be something you have to give up in order to obtain something that is worth more to you than the cost of giving up that thing. The same is true for education. You can't get an education for free, but you can get it for less than what it costs to go to college. That is why college is so important. It gives you the opportunity to gain knowledge and skills that will help you in your future career.

Cars are an integral part of society today, from the hustling bustling cities to far out in the countryside, these machines can be found everywhere, but lately there has been a new trend spreading across the modern world: The limitations on cars.

The use of cars is steadily decreasing throughout the Americas and Western Europe. Germany home to the most advanced car-free suburban community VAUBAN. VAUBAN is the pinnacle of modern car-free suburban living, the new area lies just outside of Freiburg, providing a near complete self sufficient way of living, without relying on the use of cars. As the case with most suburban residences, getting to and from the urban cities is nessessary due to the need to restock food and get to work. In the case of this city it has significantly reduced the emitions from vehicles via public transport and the erection of several shops, just walking distance from the community.

Due to the smog caused by the rise of pollution by the emitions of vehicles, Paris made an attempt to ban cars from its streets, alternating between even numbered and odd numbered liscense plates. The ban sparked outrage among the citizens over the strictness of the ban, but the effects were worthwhile as the smog had cleared up enough for the ban to be lifted.

The limitations on carsare not just restricted to Europe, the Americas have also taken an intrest in reducing the pollution caused by cars. In 2002 BOGOTA, Colombia, for the third year in a row had a day completely devoid of cars. The participants, all of Bogota's 7 million citzens, used seperate means of transportation to cut the emitions released by cars, only permitting the use of buses and taxis as vehicular transportation.

In the U.S. the use of cars is on the decline, with the number of miles driven per person dropping 9% as of April 2013 to record lows scince January 1995. This decrease is caused in part by the recovering economy and the arrival of new methods of keeping in touch. The executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, Bill Ford, has proposed a plan to create a world where the personal ownership of a vehicle would be in his words ""impractical and undesirable.""

In this new age of awareness to the effects of pollution and the means to fight against them, these limitations may be the first steps on a long journey to the restoration of our planet.",0
"""Failure is not the worst thing, not to try is worst thing in the world."" To become successful, people must try. They should not give up. If people fail and grow up without losing hope, they can be successful in their future. Although some people thought failure is not good for their life, nevertheless, some were thought failure plays an important role in their life, because, it makes them to learn more about themselevs and become successful in their life.

Failure can make people to learn more about their self. Because after failing, people can know themselves better than before. They can know about their strength and weakness. For example, Generic_Name told her friend that she is good at Science and English. But she said she is not good at math. For that, she don't like to do math at home or do it by herself. She always copied from board in classroom. Because she never try to do it. Suddenly, one day in her math class, she was called by her teacher to solve a math in board. First she was saying that she doesn't know how to do it. Fortunately after looking at the question, she did it. And then after this, she got to realize that she know how to solve the equation problem. Which makes her feel confident about math and herself. While she was talking, one of her friend interrupted her. And said that, he was satisfied with her math. Unfortunately, she failed one of her test, which makes her feel bad. After test correction, she got to understand what she missed. So she prepared herself for retake and she took the test second time and then she pass the test on second time with a good grade. Some people who fail on first time can also prepare themselves for next time. Which can take them one step ahead of their goal.

Furthermore, failure can make people successful in their life. To become successful people have to have positive enthusiasm. For example, Generic_Name is senior of Generic_School. In order to graduate she need to pass her English SOL. Because when she was a junior, she didn't pass her English 11 SOL. But this time she tried her best with positive energy and she didn't gave up. As a result, she pass her English SOL this time. Some people also cannot reach their goal in first time. But that doesn't mean, they never can be successful. To reach a goal, people need to pass the small steps first. If they fail, they can try their best for second time. And always there is a second option for every problem. For to become success, people need to learn from failure and they have to try again and again. And then they can become successful on thier life.

Overall, without loss of enthusiasm people can reach their goal by failure. People can successfully reach in their goal if they learn from failure. From failure people can learn more about themselves. And people have to have positive energy and hope to handle any situation. Because failure is an important role that plays in the pursuit of success.",0
"Asking for advice is something very resourceful and will help people make better choices .When seeking multiple opinions they can all vary depending on the type of person you speak to. When speaking to a very low profiled person they will most likely give you weak advice. However when speaking to someone well known like a best friend or family member the outcome of the advice will be stronger.

When asking for advice from a very low profiled person the result of their opinion will most likely be weak. Advice is something that has to be helpful and very important because it will guide you to make better choices. You shouldnt ask someone you dont know for advice because of the their lack of knowledge about you. It's like asking a stranger how to get along with your parents,they wouldnt know how to respond but will most likely give you a small tip and say "" Just listen to them'' and move on as if they are not concerned. If you take that advice you will realize that it was so dull and that it wasnt helpful at all. This is why you should ask more people and seek more advice. The man who said ''Just listen to them'' was one opinion but there is many more to hear out from that are more valuable.

When asking for advice from a well known person or friend the result of their opinion will be strong. Unlike from a low profiled person or someone well unknown the result of the their opinion will be weak. Asking for advice from a well known person such as family member or friend will have a stronger outcome. The advice will have a stronger outcome because they know you well enough to provide you with what you need. If you are having problems with your parents it is possible that you will ask a best friend or a sibling for advice. Perhaps they will give you a strong tip or will talk further into depth about it. The advice they probably tell you is ""Show respect"" and ""follow directions the first time given"" .These tips are very useful so you take the advice and use it. You can see that those tips were more useful than the strangers tips this is why seeking out to multiple opinions of advice can help make better choices.

Asking the close family member gave the most efficient advice because of the knowledge they had for you. Asking someone such as a family member or a best friend for advice is most likely the best choice that you can choose. However when asking a stranger or someone you dont know for advice will give you the least efficient outcome and provide you with the weakest form of advice. The stranger didnt give the best advice because of his lack of knowledge about you.

Talking to more than one person for advice is always the way to go. Talking to more than one person for advice is the best choice, because you can see everyone's perspective on what they see. If you ask one person for advice you can not really compare their opinion to anyone else's. When you see two perspective's there is always two side of the story. When one side is told there is a possibility it can be very dull and useless. When the other side is told it could be the complete opposite and have everything you need in it. This is why seeking more than one opinion of advice is important ,you can compare it to the other opinions you have and conclude it to what you need. This is why talking to more than one person for advice is a better choice than talking to just one.",0
"The use of facial recognition technology like the Facial Action Coding System to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom could have both benefits and drawbacks. 

On one hand, this technology may help teachers gain valuable insights into how their students are feeling about different lessons, activities, or teaching methods. If a teacher notices many students appeared bored or frustrated during a particular lesson, for example, they could adjust their approach to reengage the class. Identifying emotions like confusion or lack of understanding could also help teachers recognize when students need extra support or a different explanation of the material. This feedback could help optimize classroom instruction to better meet students' needs and keep them engaged.

However, there are also some potential downsides. Continually monitoring students' facial expressions with this technology risks invading their privacy and could make them feel uncomfortable knowing their emotions are being analyzed. Students may feel pressure to mask their true feelings or lose spontaneity in the classroom if they know a computer is scrutinizing their every expression. There is also a risk that teachers could misinterpret the technology's readings of students' emotions or draw incorrect conclusions. Cultural differences could also impact how facial expressions are understood by the system. 

Overall, while this technology offers some potential benefits for gaining insights that could improve instruction, there are also valid privacy and implementation concerns. More research would likely be needed to determine if the benefits outweigh the risks and how best to address issues of student comfort, consent, and preventing misinterpretations before widespread adoption in classrooms. Both the positives and limitations would need to be considered to determine if this type of facial recognition is ultimately a valuable use of the technology in an educational setting.",1
"Greetings! I have heard that you think the Face on Mars, is a face that was created by aliens. I believe that this ""face"" is just a natural landform. I will support my claim why I think this, and maybe you will finally believe, that there are no such things as aliens.

There are many reasons why the Face is just a natural landform. On the second sentence paragraph, it says that we scientists have figured that the Face was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only that this one had unusual shadows, which made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. The reason some people think it look like an alien, was because it looked like a real face, but it looks like a face, because the shadows formed on the rock give off illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth. On paragraph 7, it is said that Machael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the origninal Viking phots. Later on, thoughsands of anxious web surfers were waiting for the image to appear. When it finally did, the site revealed a natural landorm. People were not satisfied, because it was a cloudy day on Mars. The scientists decided to prove that it was just a landform, so when it was not cloudy, they took another picture. In the final paragraph, paragraph 12, it says that what the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a btte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. A man name Garvin says, ""That's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The lava dome is most of Middle Butte in the Snake Riber Plaint of Idaho.

So, in conclusion, if you first thought that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, than I hope I have gave your enough information, and persuaded you that it is really just a natural landform. I am sorry if you thought it was made by aliens, but it wasn't. I hope that you could understand, and see that it was just the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.",0
"The use of the Facial action coding system technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, because that would mean our technology intelligence is improving. The more improvement we get in technology, the more the world will change. The Facial Action Coding System will show how the person that is getting tested or is using this, how they feeling. What if your look is the opposite than what you are feeling or you, as in yourself dont feel anything?

The Facial Action Coding System can help identify the look you are given from another person. This technology wouldn't be like math homework, your science teacher grading your lab assignment, or a robot giving out data, it would be more like a clear resulting answer. It would not be a percentage, so that would help others who are younger and have yet learned about percentages.

The world would be controlled by a computer rather than humans. Computers can give out wrong data, for example, if you would determine to search something up for a project and it came up with different websites,(different websites can give different answers) like Wikipedia, it could give you a wrong answer and then you would ask your teacher or professor if your data seemed right he/she would be like "" This is not the right information"" then pulls out a book determining the answer to your question that gives the right information you need to complete your project. Anway, if technology starts controlling the world, who would control the technology? This will lead to another device and then another, then finally we would completely be controlled by technology/ electronics more than what the world is at the moment. the technology could have a malfunction and cause people to start worrying and frightened. sometimes your facial expression is different than what you are actually feeling.

In conclusion, the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System can be a good idea, but at the same time can be a horrid idea. It all depends on peoples perspective. Different people result in different answers. Not everyone will result in ahving the same exact answer like others.",0

Taking your own path and self-teaching can be very important life skills as they can lead to creative problem solving and a more independent mindset. In today's world, it's our responsibility to adapt and grow our knowledge on our own as the world keeps changing - this is why self-teaching is more important than ever. It allows us to make our own decisions and take things into our own hands. Taking your own path can lead to achieving the ""impossible"" as it allows you to think unconventionally and explore outside the box. For example, Thomas Edison famously achieved the ""impossible"" by creating the lightbulb - something that was thought to be impossible. He did this through his self-teaching, willingness to explore unknown territory, and refusal to be overwhelmed by the challenge. Knowing where you want to go in life and taking the initiative to learn is a step in the right direction and is necessary to achieve your goals. Taking your own path encourages self-directed learning, curiosity, and development of transferable skills. Ultimately, taking your own path and self-teaching are key life skills that enable us to think beyond what we already know and take matters into our own hands.",1
"I would agree with Emerson's in this world be yourself which is most important things . If we have confidence your own because we face with different kind of stutionan that we have to fight and difficult staff in life never give back keep working hard encourage find way that take of your stutional.

For example: If we start something new that took long time to resive that result we have to be patient for that greatest thing never get quickly every beginning took time for that accomplishment we are face diffcualte time like might field are might be win for first chance never lost our hope keep working hard.

don't depended to other people never improve in life because depended to other. In the world indefinite multitude or great quantity or distance make a difference a way. For all the world in every way ex acuity copies which look for all the world like the original. You should trying to become succeed in life to get of the way from problem find solution how to succeed in you're life.

First, trying as mach could doing make more successful this new world sometimes is life easy but, sometimes is not because life complicate and busy. If continue this way your life totally change working hard more successful and, more achievements. Should be put the goals what should I, do to accomplishment my goals for that you should keep trying to never stop your trying because noting impassable without trying. When start something for that need trying to resive achieve your pride. Those people are trying are working hard now the a have more power.

Then, greatest thing you have to skill which is more important that part of life also. Without skills never get achievement because everything bast on standing everyone the have special skills that make encourage and make them successful in the life. For example one person good in the reading some are the writing, some cooking, some are management, and some are making with hand ext... Those are part of skill everyone they had for that resance this greatest achievement this very important. Those people the don't a have those are more make terrible never couldn't solve the own problem the need the come to help them this is showing weakness a person. Some people thing the don't have skill this impossible but, never are used own skills the thing couldn't do it the always thinking negative they lost.

After, beyond every good thing the have achievement. When get our aschivemnt that made feeling proud your self encourage you doing good things that challenge of life the person make more successful.

I do agree with Emerson statement the encourage you working hard trying your life you would be get greatest achievement.",0
"Limited car usage can provide significant benefits for communities and the environment. According to multiple sources, reducing reliance on personal vehicles can help address serious issues like pollution, traffic congestion, and climate change.

Air pollution from traffic emissions poses major health risks. As Passage 1 notes, vehicles are a leading source of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides which contribute to respiratory illnesses. Limiting personal car trips would decrease these harmful pollutants released into the atmosphere. Public transit produces significantly fewer emissions per passenger than private cars. Transitioning some drivers to buses or trains could thus help cities attain cleaner air.  

Traffic congestion not only wastes people's time but also fuel as cars sit idling. Passage 2 refers to how a growing number of vehicles has led to more time stuck in congestion. If a portion of commuters shifted to alternative modes of transport like cycling, walking or public transit, there would be fewer cars competing for road space during peak hours. This could reduce vehicular bottlenecks and free up traffic flow. With less congestion, fuel costs from idling would also decline, providing an economic benefit.

Additionally, restricting car usage would lower greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector according to Passage 3. As one of the fastest growing sources of climate pollution, curbing automobile dependence can make an impact in mitigating the carbon footprint. Low-emission public transit, walking and cycling can replace short-distance car trips which significantly damage the environment. Transitioning to more sustainable modes will support efforts to curb global warming for future generations. 

In summary, limiting car usage through promotion of public transit and active mobility brings multiple advantages by reducing air and noise pollution, traffic congestion, and emissions responsible for the climate crisis. A balanced multi-modal transportation system with fewer personal vehicles can offer communities cleaner air and a more efficient movement of people and goods.",1
"Many people believe the face on Mars is an extraterrestrial being. Although it may seem true, the face is a natural landform. There are many facts to show this is a natural landform.

Many scientists have seen this face as life on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists have said there is life on Mars,and NASA is trying to hide it from the people. In 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over the face, but they revealed there was no face to be seen. There was only a natural landform. Scientists have began to lose hope of ever seeing the face again. If they were ever able to find the face again, they would have money to do more investigation. Although there were no extratrrestrial beings, people still believed the face would soon appear again. Scientists are still trying to look for ways to explain it all.

Reasearchers are still looking for the face on Mars. Scientist Jim Garvin states, ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes an the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were !"" He is comparing airplanes, pyramids,and small shacks to the face which is no longer there. This statement proves that the face is a natural landform. Many landforms on Earth form then after years or even decades, they decay down to nothing. Although landforms are always forming, they are also being destroyed. Without oxygen on Mars, there is no way the face is able to survive.

Although the face is not real and is a natural landform, researchers will stop at nothing to prove it is real. Conspiracy theorists are still trying to find the truth. Little do they know the truth has been revealed, the face is just a natural landform.",0
"In the past two decades, the world has seen a dramatic shift in the way people get around. From the rise of ride-sharing services to the introduction of electric vehicles, the landscape of transportation is changing rapidly. While some may disagree, I believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

The first reason I believe this to be true is the increasing popularity of ride-sharing services. Companies like Uber and Lyft have made it easier and more affordable for people to get around without owning a car. This has resulted in a decrease in car ownership, especially among younger generations. In addition, the rise of electric vehicles has made it more cost-effective to own a car. Electric vehicles are more efficient and require less maintenance than traditional gas-powered cars, making them more attractive to potential buyers.

The second reason I believe there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years is the increasing focus on sustainability. Governments around the world are taking steps to reduce emissions and combat climate change. This includes investing in public transportation, encouraging the use of electric vehicles, and incentivizing carpooling. These initiatives are making it easier for people to get around without relying on their own car.

Finally, the rise of autonomous vehicles could also lead to a decrease in car ownership. Autonomous vehicles are expected to be safer, more efficient, and more affordable than traditional cars. This could make them a more attractive option for those looking to get around without owning a car.

In conclusion, I believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This is due to the increasing popularity of ride-sharing services, the focus on sustainability, and the rise of autonomous vehicles. These factors will make it easier and more affordable for people to get around without relying on their own car.

Mistakes can have a great impact on a person's life, leading them to become better human beings in the long run. Everyone at some point has made an error that had a lasting effect. Although it can be stressful and uncomfortable to make a mistake, it can help a person grow in many ways. 

Mistakes often push people out of their comfort zones and encourage them to try something new. This can open up new doors of insight and learning that they would have otherwise missed out on. It can also help them become more aware of themselves and their place in the world, leading to increased levels of emotional intelligence. With this increased self-knowledge, people are more equipped to handle difficult situations in the future. 

Another important benefit of mistakes is that they help people to become more resilient. When a person makes an error, they may be embarrassed or discouraged at first, but they eventually pick themselves up and learn from what went wrong. This can give them the strength they need to overcome any obstacles in their lives. 

I can personally attest to how my mistakes have helped me become a better person. Last year I was involved in a difficult situation with a close friend. I made a mistake in the way I handled it, and felt guilty about it for some time. The experience made me realize how my words and actions can affect others, so I made sure that in the future I was more considerate and aware of the needs of others. 

In conclusion, mistakes can be difficult to experience, but they can bring out the best in people and help them become better human beings. With a willingness to learn and grow, mistakes can be used not only to gain insight, but also to build resilience and personal growth.",1
"Dear Senator,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing as a concerned student and citizen to express my viewpoint on the ongoing debate about the Electoral College system employed for presidential elections. After considering multiple perspectives, I maintain that we should adopt direct election by popular vote, ensuring the principles of democracy are upheld.

The founding fathers developed the Electoral College as a compromise to balance power between the Congress and the ordinary citizens (Office of the Federal Register, Passage 1). This system, however, has proven itself outmoded and unfair to voters. As Bradford Plumer asserts, the Electoral College ends up with candidates spending majority of their campaign time focusing solely on the ‘swing’ states while neglecting states where they perceive little chance of winning (Passage 13). This unfairly distorts the electoral process in favor of certain states and voters, which contravenes the principles of equality espoused in a democratic society.

The flaws in the Electoral College system are rampant. As noted in Passage 11, faithless electors, potential electoral ties, and the ""disaster factor"" underscore its imperfections. It is alarming how easily electors can defy the will of the people and how an electoral tie can undermine the popular choice.

While supporters, such as Judge Richard Posner, advocate for the Electoral College citing reasons like certainty of outcome, favoring widespread appeal for candidates, and avoiding runoff elections (Passages 18-22), I argue that these benefits could still exist in a direct popular voting system. If no candidate achieves an outright majority, we could implement a runoff between the top candidates. Furthermore, the importance of “trans-regional appeal” and focusing on electoral votes in large states can still be relevant even under a popular vote system.

A switch to a direct popular vote would mean that every American’s vote has equal impact. It reorients the focus of campaigns to all citizens, not just those in ‘swing’ states. Additionally, given how often the winner of the popular vote does not actually win the presidency due to the Electoral College, it cultivates a sense of disenfranchisement among voters. 

Democracy is the power of the people, and we should strive to ensure that power is distributed equally among everyone, not just a select few states or voters deemed to be in strategic locations. Abolishing the Electoral College and adopting a direct popular voting system is a necessary reform. It not only upholds the spirit of democracy but also gives credence to the 'one citizen, one vote' principle.

Thank you for your valuable time, and I hope the points raised will serve as food for thought. 

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]

"Ever wonder what is a "" Electoral College? Like what is that suppose to mean?, A internet campus, Tech class, or etc. Well its not actually A Electoral college is made for up coming presidents. That differrnt selections of people go and meet the president and vice presdent. The congress. The College consits up to 238 votes and only 270 on select for the presidecny.

The president electron is held evey four yeas an the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you are about to select a presdint you vote for your candidan

Two guys named Rich, Jummy carter, Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO and they are not alone according to Gallup poll in 2000, after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. The single best argument agianst the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The election would be thrown to the house or Representatives, where state delegations vote to the presdient. Because each state casts only one vote to give th voters vote to the president and another for the congress,

The House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the wall of the people, And if an electoral tie seems unlikely. A the base level the electoral colloege is unfair to voters. Because of the winner takes it all system in each state , candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chances at win at these king of states for the president. They focuse only on the the tight races in the ""swing"" states. There many things in the Electoral College that many people on they outside don't know what the Congress or the up running presidents are struggling it looks easy on the inside bu on the ouside wow they have a lot to work on.",0
"Are you happy the way you vote today, would you be happy if we were to change the way we vote for president. Because they are thinking to change the electroal vote. I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it has been doing us good for a long time, and if we do change it, it would take a while for us to get used to it.

The first reason why it think that we shouldnt change the Electoral College is because it has been doing us good for almost 300 years. Let me ask you a question, do you change or fix something thats not broken,Than why change the Electoral College. We have had fair Elections in the pass and we still do, people vote for who they want as president of the united states, and if they get the better half of the votes than they are president. As we saw in 2012 when ""Obama received 61.7 percent of the Electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him  and Romney....because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all- basis, even a cery slight popularity in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state"" which is in source 3.

The second reason why I think that we should keep the electoral college is because it would take time for us to get used to the new method. Since we vote every 4 years and if we get a new way to vote there will be a few that wont know how to vote the new way and when it comes for it to vote again people will forget how they voted for the president. So if they vote for the person who they actually dont want its not like they can vote again. But as I said earlier its easy to vote with the Electoral College as its a winner takes all. The electoral vote does have a couple flaws that could be changed easily but in all other ways the elctoral vote is the way to go.

And thats why I think that we should keep the electoral College because one it hasd been doing us good and it will take us a while to get used to the new voing system.",0
"To all my fellow citizens, I must tell you about all the spectacular things cities are doing. They have started giving up their cars to decrease the congestion and pollution rate. The cities that have already tried it have seen a huge benifit.

A little community in  Vauban, Germany was the fist city to let go of their cars. Residents say they feel much less stress than when they had cars. What a suprise that not having to worry about traffic would reduce stress. It has also drastically reduced tailpipe emissions. They're have been rearangments by stores, they have been relocated along public sidewalks so that people no longer hae to drive across town to the mall or stores. They can simply walk or bike down the road to pick up whatever might interest them.

The next place that picked up this amazing wonderful idea was none other than the busiest city in France; Paris. Paris ordered its citizens to leave their car at home, and if they didn't comply would pay a 22-euro fine. 4000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to this fine, but if I was able to buy a car and not drive then I would be among those who would have their car impounded. On the bright side congestion went down 60% which is amazing for one of the busiest cities in the world.

The next place thats wanting to pick up this no car trend is none other than right here in the United States, and were supporting it. Each year that goes by recent studies have suggest that Americans aren't buying as many cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. If this pattern progresses it could solve our atomosphere problem. If huge cities and like Paris,Vauban,and The United States will give up cars. Than that alone could drastically change the path that our planet is headed for.

So citizens I hope this encourages you to cut back on your car usage. Take the bike out every once and a while or just walk. Whats the worst that could happen if you limited your automobile usage.",0
"Dear Teachers,

Date: 03/12/19

Address:

Center St Generic_City

In my opinion working in group should be more benefits.

Teacher should let student work in group.

Teacher should be allow students to work in group. There are three reason why should they let student work in group:

Working in group think more stronger and faster. Each of every students can catch a mistake. It would benefits to get more information about what topic they will do it.

Firstly, you can look more than one idea. Secondly, each students can make one question about what they are doing. Thirdly, if you work in group you can be more comfortable with your work.

Your working should have the best idea and should not be any mistake because before to give the work to the teacher every students should look at it.

It would be more interesting to meet another students and know what they can do it, and if you can help in something that they don't it. Also, in some schooler teacher let student to work in group because some students don't feel comfortable to do the work by themselves. Some activities should be necessary to do in group.

For example, when they are doing a project. However, most of the classses have workshit to do in group.

For example, make experiment in a lab, present in front of the class.

Some students say that work in group is more funny than being alone.

Sometimes, teacher don't like to put student in group becasue they observe that when student are in group they just talk about anothers thnig not about what they tell you , but not all the students like that.

In conclusion,

for these reasons is more benefits to work and group than work alone.

Sincerely,

"The ""Face on Mars"" is a landform seen in photographs of the surface of Mars. Some people believe that this landform is proof that alien life exists and that this landform was created by said aliens. However, there is plenty of information to disprove this. This information is found in the article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars.""

The article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" states, ""Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say some conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" This statement suggests that NASA would have no reason to hide evidence of alien life, as this would benefit NASA greatly. If NASA had discovered evidence of alien life, NASA would have presented it as such.

Later on, photographs were taken of the landform once again. However, the camera had to ""peer through whispy clouds to see the Face."" Because of this, some skeptics believed that alien markings were hidden by the haze, which is shown in the quote, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by the haze."" In response to this, another picture was taken on a cloudless day, showing that the Face was nothing more than a natural land form.

This landform is similar to some of the landforms on Earth, as shown by the quote, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" Another quote to prove that the Face is similar to formations on Earth is, ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This suggests that the Face could have been formed much in the same way as the Earth formation mentioned in the quote.

The fact that, in the photographs of the fornation, there is no evidence to prove alien life is also a factor to consider. A quote by Garvin shows why this is an important peice of information to consider. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were any objets in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This proves that because no evidence of alien life can be seen in the pictures, means that there is none. In these pictures, claims Garvin, you could discern objects easily and tell what they are. If so, NASA can easily confirm that this land formation is natural and that there is no evidence of alien life.

Thus, the Face on Mars is a natural land formation. If it was evidence of alien life, NASA would have presented the information as such. NASA would have then pursued the lead that proved alien life exsisted by attempting to find this alien life or more evidence to prove that alien life exsisted. NASA would have beneiftted greatly if the Face had been created by alien life forms. This formation is also very similar to some land formations found on Earth. If such formations are found natrually on Earth, could they not also be found naturally on other planets? This land formation on Mars is natrual, as similar land formations are found naturally on Earth and NASA finding proof of alien life would have benefitted them greatly. If these things are true, then the Face on Mars is a land form that occurred naturally, and we, the people of Earth, have yet to find evidence that alien life exsists in our univserse.",0
"The use of technology to read the expressions of students in a classroom could be very valuable. In class, no matter what grade a student is in or what gender the student is; they often get confused. When confusion takes place some students would rather not ask for help because they may feel ashamed and notfo as smart as their peers for not understanding.

Teachers are human too, however some could know when something is wrong with a student while others on the other hand wouldn't. The technology that could read emotional expressions could see if a student is confused, frustrated or even angry because they aren't understanding the work given to them. The teacher could use the computer software to detect if the student is progressing during instructional time. This could prevent students from failing on exams and getting poor grades on assignments.

Using the computer software to read the emotional expressions of students could even help the teachers communicate with the students to see what they are struggling with. This way the teacher could discuss with the student about which parts the student does not understand. It would be smart and hughly effecient to enforce this computer software in classrooms. It would have a great effect on not only the students so they could ge good grades, but the teachers too; so they can know how to verbally express themselves while teaching.",0
"Everyone has different opinions. These opinions are important when it comes to seeking advice. People tend to ask multiple people on what they should do in a certain situation. Seeking different advice and opinions can help a lot because, first of all, the more opinions you have the more open-minded you could be on the situation. Secondly, it helps make a better and safer decision. Lastly, sometimes the advice teaches you a life lesson. When people seek for advice they usually ask more than one person, and its great because different opinions influence your view on the situation, help keep and open mind about the situation, and learn a lesson .

Having a clear view of a siutation is very helpful, thats why people usualy ask for more than one opinion. A clear view of a situation helps influence your point of view and descision. For example, a girl and her best friend got into a fight, and she went to go and seek advice from her other friends on what to do, some said to ignore him, but the others said that she should consider giving some space because he could be stressed about something and that maybe she could bring him a gift. She listened to her friends, and decided to make him a gift and give him some space unless he needs help. A few days later, he got her a gift and apologized and they both made up. See if she didnt ask for advice from others, she could have lost her best friend, or make up a few months later.

Being open minded doesnt only make you a better person, but it also helps make better descisions. Seeking advice from diffrent people, does help keep and open mind. For example, a girl's boyfriend has been acting distance lately, so she went and seeked advice from her and his friends. The girl's friends assumed he was cheating, but the guy's friends told her to be patient, and that hes perfectly fine. She decided to listen her boyfriend's friends. About a week later, he proposed to her, turns out he was surprising her and staying distance because he was scared he might tell her by accident. The girl's friends jumped to assumptions, and so if she hadnt asked the boyfriend's friends, things could have been diffuclt.

Believe it or not, advices from multiple people, could help you learn a lesson. Just like the last two stories, they all learned something. One of the girls learned to not jump to assumption and be patient, and the other learned to be more open minded about what people might be going through. There is also this story Im sure you heard of it, its called Slow and Steady wins the race by Aseop. It was a story about a rabbit and a turtle, the rabbit was fast and always sure that he would win, he was also selfish. One day the rabbit challenged the turtle onto a race, and the turtle agreed. It was the day of the race, the rabbit was already half way while the turtle was all the way behind because he is slow. So then the rabbit decided to take a nap, which gave the turtle time to win. At the end the turtle won, while the rabbit was alsepp, the rabbit was mad. That day the rabbit learned that slow and steady wins the race.

When people seek advice, they usualy go to multiple people, and that is probably because it helps influence your point of view on the situation, keep an open mind, and learn something.",0

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to continue its use in electing the President of the United States. While some argue for the abolition of the Electoral College in favor of a popular vote system, I believe that the current system provides several important benefits that should not be overlooked.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. In the event of a dispute, it is less likely than in a popular vote system. This is due to the fact that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in each state ensures that even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory. Although a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible, it is highly unlikely. This level of certainty ensures that the will of the people is accurately reflected in the outcome of the election.

Another important benefit of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must appeal to multiple regions in order to be successful. This is crucial for a candidate to be an effective president, as it prevents them from favoring one region over others. It ensures that every region's interests are considered and prevents any region from feeling disenfranchised.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes leads to candidates focusing their campaign efforts on swing states. This means that voters in these states receive the most attention and information from the candidates, making them the most thoughtful voters. It is important for these voters, who are likely to decide the election, to have a thorough understanding of the candidates' platforms and policies. This helps to ensure that the most informed voters have the greatest influence in choosing the president.

The Electoral College also provides balance to the political weight of each state, as it restores some weight to large states that would otherwise be overshadowed by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. The electoral votes awarded to each state are directly related to their population, which means that large states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This helps to ensure that the concerns and issues of both large and small states are addressed by candidates.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections in instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This can greatly simplify the presidential election process and avoids the potential complications that come with run-off elections. Instead, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, ensuring a smooth transition of power.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome, ensures that the President has trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, provides balance to the political weight of each state, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While some may argue for a popular vote system, it is crucial to recognize the important benefits that the Electoral College offers. I believe that this system should be preserved in order to maintain an effective and fair method of electing the President of the United States.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will take my views into consideration and continue to support the Electoral College. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1
"Electoral college is a dictator, boss, or lottery! It's unfair. It is the duty and privilege of the people to select our government leader. We should choose based on our point of view. The second source conveys effective points to consider, such as, directly voting for the president and the disaster factor. It also informs us that, even though unlikely, there is possibility of a tie.

Directly voting for a president is an issue addressed in both source 2 and 3. They agree that technically, we're not really voting for a president. The second source tells us that when we vote, it is actually sent to the state elector, and it is they electors who vote for the president. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer voting directly over our system now. Even though source 3 gives us reasons to keep the electoral college, it will support us when we say we aren't actually voting for the president directly.

Source 2 gives us the ""single best argument"" against the elector college as what it refers to as the disaster factor. It uses the fiasco of 2000, the biggest election crisis in a century, as an example of why we are so lucky. The state legislatures were technically responsible for picking electors and they didn't always have to listen or acknowledge the people's opinionvote. It takes us further back by giving an example of segregationists back in 1960 where John F. Kennedy almost lost the popular vote of Louisiana when their legislature replaced Democratic electors with new ones that opposed him Kennedy. What source 2 calls ""faithless"" electors, electors who dont believe that their candidate will win hence faithless, have occasionly voted in favor of their choice, disregarding the decision of the people.

The third source gives us five reasons in favor of the electoral college method. Even though we don't directly vote, the party chooses the electors and trust that they will select the voted nominee, and it ensures us that the trust is almost never deceived. Disputes over the outcome because of an Electoral College Vote is possible, but not as likely as the popular vote. The next reason given informs us that a region doesnt have enough electoral votes to win the election for the president they favor. ""Swing States"" is another reason. It refers to states that can be persuaded and aren't necessarily entitled to a particular candidate, so they will really pay attention to what the candidates have to say, their campaign. ""Big states"" is the fourth reason and is focused on population advantages. Meaning, a state with smaller population will have just as much impact on the election as one with a larger population, its equal. It is not necessarily a good thing when the last reason says ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast"". Wouldn't that raise the risk of a tie? Though, it is extremely unlikely that a single vote may decide the president and voters in these elections want to express their opinion and prefernece.

I am in favor of abolishment of the unfair, oldfashioned, and irrational electoral college method. Plus, reasons to keep this system arent as strong and factual as the reasons to abolish it.",0
"Some of the world's greatest inventions would not exist without collaboration. Do you think that Steve Jobs started the increasingly popular brand, Apple, all by himself? We have all asked someone for advice at some point in our life, since getting insight from other people makes life a lot easier. But is it really the more the merrier when it comes to giving and receiving advice? I think that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can make more people happy, someone could catch something another person missed, and certain people specialize in different things.

One reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is you can make more people happy. If you only talk to one person, you are only getting insight from that person's point of view. But by talking to multiple people, you will get a better perspective on what most people want so you can make more people happy. One example of this is a wedding. Say you are planning a wedding but you don't know whether to serve chocolate cake or vanilla cake. If you only ask one of the guests what flavor they want, you will not know if you are making multiple people happy because do don't have their opinion. But if you survey everyone on what cake they want, you will see everyone's opinion. Therefore, you can make a better choice and make more people happy.

Another reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is someone could catch something another person missed. By asking just one person for advice, you could miss something very important that another person would notice. If you are making a big decision, that extra opinion could change your life forever. For example, say you are debating what college to go to, NYU, or Stanford. After asking one person for advice, you decided you want to go to NYU. But by asking another person for advice, you realized that NYU does not have what you want to major in and you go to Stanford. By asking multiple people, you will make sure that you are not missing anything important.

The final reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is certain people specialize in different things. If you only ask one person for their opinion, they might not know what to do as well as someone else who specializes in the thing you are asking about. Say you are planning to build a pool in your backyard. By only asking an architect, you will know how to make the pool functional, but you will not know what shaped pool is best, what concrete you should use, or where in the backyard is best for the pool to go. But by asking a designer too, you would have a better looking pool since they specialize in making things look good on the outside.

These are the reasons why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. In this generation, people are collaborating more and more. But without people giving and receiving advice, we would not have all these miraculous advances in technology, fashion, agriculture, and more. Because you can make more people happy, someone could catch something another person missed, and certain people specialize in different things, asking multiple people for advice can help someone make a better choice.",0
"Schools should require all students to participate in a volunteer program. The world is becoming increasingly interconnected and complex, making it more important than ever for young people to understand the importance of civic engagement. Schools can play an important role in providing their students with opportunities to make meaningful contributions to their communities through volunteerism. Students who take part in these programs not only gain valuable life experiences, but also develop a greater appreciation of the value of service and helping others. For this reason, schools should be required to include a mandatory volunteer program as part of their curriculum. Volunteer work provides an array of benefits that are often overlooked when considering what's best for our youth today. It gives them real-world experience outside the classroom setting and allows them to sharpen skills such as problem solving, communication, collaboration, leadership and teamwork – all key qualities employers seek out in potential hires down the line. By teaching students how vital it is to actively engage with those around them from different backgrounds and perspectives, they become more tolerant citizens prepared for living vibrant lives post high school graduation or college matriculation . . Furthermore , volunteering also has major personal benefits which could lead to improved mental health among adolescents struggling with depression or anxiety since giving back typically fosters feelings of satisfaction and accomplishment . Research shows that engaging in positive activities like volunteering can help reduce stress levels while simultaneously boosting wellbeing . Therefore , incorporating volunteer hours into school curricula serves both educational goals by fostering team building between peers while enabling self-improvement in turn; ultimately allowing individuals involved more successful futures free from psychological distress . In conclusion , requiring all students at every level - elementary through college -to complete some form voluntary service will have many long lasting effects beyond just academic performance improvement ; including enhanced social interaction knowledge as well as improved mental health states over time due its emotion improving factors simply not found elsewhere within conventional education systems today. Allowing future generations direct access via our educational institutions allows each individual student invaluable

"I believe that we have developed into a ""throw-away society"" because we are filling up our environment with so many plastic bags and rubbish that we cannot fully dispose of. There are many reasons why this is happening, but the main reason is that we are not recycling enough.

Plastic bags are a common example of rubbish that we are filling up our environment with. We use them for a variety of purposes, but the most common use is to store food. We usually only use them for a few minutes, and then we throw them away. But if we recycled them, we could create new plastic bags that could be used again and again.

Another example of rubbish that we are filling up our environment with is rubbish that we can't recycle. This includes things like plastic bottles and packaging. We usually throw these things away, but if we recycled them, we could create new products that could be used again and again.

We are also filling up our environment with rubbish that we can't compost. This includes things like plastic bags and packaging. We usually throw these things away, but if we composted them, we could create new products that could be used again and again.

All of these things are examples of rubbish that we are filling up our environment with. If we recycled more of these things, we would be able to reduce the amount of rubbish that we are filling up our environment with.

"The student has studied lot of subjects in the school stage. He/she is not able to concentrate on any one of them due to lack of time.

I agree with this statement. If the student is unable to focus on one particular subject, then it would be better for him/her to study more than one subject at the same time, rather than focusing on a single subject and neglecting other subjects.

"All around the world different countries have been noticing some things in life that are just better without cars or atleast less cars. With less cars things are more calming its also better for everyone, including the environment.

To begin with, things can be way more calm in a life without cars. Many people happen to believe that cars can change how you feel for example ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way""3. Heidrun Walter always felt tense with a car now she feels calm and relaxed. Life with less cars can be so much more relaxing without all the loud annoying noises cars make. In Vauban they are making some changes to how the people live so they can live more easy and calm. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in a lowcar suburban life.""6. The way this civilization is all the people live close by and everything is close by so you dont really need a car. If everything is close by everything can be more fluent and calm.

In addition, it may be more calm without cars but it is also better for you and the environment. ""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emission in europe... and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the United States.""5. Wherever you are in the world greenhouse gasses will most likley affect your environment in some unnatrual way and that is not the best thing for you, the people you know, or all the plants and animals. Without cars polluting earth we would be way more healthy and many animals may not be endangered or extinct like they are today.""how much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.""7. If you drive less its not just better for the environment and your health it can also be better for your wallet. If you drive less you save money on gas that you can use for many other things. Overall driving less turns out to be better for everyone.

In conclusion, people driving less can make life easier and calmer, it is also better for people, plants, animals, and don't forget your wallet.",0
"ADVICE!! People talk to more than one person for advice because they could have better options. The more options a person has a better way they could do something. People from experience should have better advice then people that has not had the experience. The more advice you get the better off you are more advice becomes into better ideas. Advice also can give you more ideas and bigger and better ideas.

The first reason I think that seeking to multiple people trying to find advice is that people with the experience of the task can help you. People from experience should have better advice then people that has not had the experience. The more experience someone has normally can give you good advice about the task.

When I need help with something I personally like to go talk to older people because they are the most likely to know how to do it and make it easier for you. That is why I go to older people for advice 95% of the time.

The final reason I think asking multiple people for advice is to give the person better options for the task and possible better ideas for another project or task. I have asked people for advice for fixing a flat tire and I have asked multiple people for advice. Nobody seemed to know how to fix a flat without just buying a new tire. Then I asked my Grand-Pa for some advice and he said I have a perfect substance for this. He came out of the shed with some of this green stuff and he told me to squirt this in youre tire. I went home and squirted in my tire and it fixed my flat. Now this green stuff helps me with a lot of flat tires. If I havent of asked a lot of people then I would of had to get a new tire for all of my ATV's, UTV's, when they got a flat this green stuff has saved me a lot of money.

This is why I think you should ask more than one person for advice.

People from experience should have better advice then people that has not had the experience. The more advice you get the better off you are more advice becomes into better ideas. I hope this essay inspired you to ask people for more advice.",0
"using facial expresions are a good way to tell someone u are mad or happy. but sometimes u cant tell the diffrence unless people smile all the time. for instince when i walk i have a mean face that dosent mean im mad i could be happy but its just how my face is. u shouldnt need technology to tell someone if your happy ot sad all they gotta do is look at your face and they should already know if your mad or sad.

if the person isnt sure they should ask and see wether if your mad or sad. mona lisa smiling is just showing that shes happy or that she was happy while taking the picture. to be honest i think u can smile and feel something other than happiness. like when someone is mad and they smile just to seem like there happy.

i really dont get how u can calculate emotions like its an emoiton not a math question u either ask if the person is mad or sad or u just guess off the facial expressions. thats how i see it in my eyes itll be much easier to just ask then to do reasurch.

i think the smile should be used to show happiness people can be happy for just a moment then change there face which i understand i do it all the time. mad face should show if your mad. sad face should show that your sad. it shouldnt have to involve technology to find out how the person feels. mona lisa is a wonderful painting but i think she was happy in the picture because she smiled.",0
"The Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress"" is stated in source 1. This is process has been around for decades, but things have changed. This process does not fit with what is happening in the present and is outdated. The election should be by popular vote.

There is a disaster factor.  According to ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", it's says that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors. The thing is that those electors can betray the trust which has happened before. You do not want to risk having someone defy the will of the people. Some people may argue that the states know what they are doing and are cautious on who to pick, but in the past the electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate. You do not want to put this in hands of someone who will not help you and the other people on such an important event like voting.

When you vote, there is a slight possibility of a tie occuring. If this were to happen, the state delegations would vote on which president. Each state will cast one vote, which is not fair because of the amount of representives in different states. ""...the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" is stated in source 2. Some people may say that the bigger states are helpful with voting because the Electoral College will balance out what the large states loss by the population votes. This still isn't fair because this is saying that the smaller states with less representatives do not have much say in the voting and this will turn off potential voters.

Some presidents may have a stronger appeal to some states then others. It may have to do with where the president is from (North, South). This goes back to how the bigger states have more power. ""...such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states,"" is stated in source 3. This means that the bigger states in the South will be known for all voting Romney since that is where he is the strongest and well liked. There may be voters in the South that were more for Obama. Smaller states may hate what Romney is doing and vote for Obama, but they do not have as much power as the bigger states. This is like the winner takes it all, they may know that they have no chance in winning. (Obama did end up winning and was titled as the 44th President of the United States. To others, they may say that each persons vote does count but it doesn't seem like it. The voters in the South didn't see any campaign ad by Romney which was not fair because he was not concerned about them not voting for him.

The Electoral College is not a fair process. It worked in the past, but not anymore. Using the popular vote process is more fair for all of the people. They have more say and there votes feel more important. This will encourage potential voters to vote and to become more involved with the political events. We need to encourage potential voters because one day, when they become older, they will be the voters of our country.",0
"When you ask for advice, you ask multiple people right? I do. One of the reasons why seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because when you ask more than one people for advice, they mostly give you different ideas and the more ideas you get from people the easier it feels to make that choice. Another reason why seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is that when you ask different people for advice they would give you their own opinions about that choice. For example, if you ask your friend for advice for a choice you are going to make, that friend might tell you something positive about it, in the other hand, if you ask another friend for advice for a choice they might tell you something bad about it which will be way different than what your other friend said. The third reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if one person told you a negative advise and the other person told you a positive advise, you could pick which one you think is helpful. The fourth reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if you ask a friend for advice they can tell you their personal thoughts about that choice and if you ask another person they might give you their personal thoughts about it. For example, if you ask a friend to tell you if you should do your homework or not that friend might say ""No dont do your homework and lets hang out"" ,in the other hand, if you ask your other friend if you should do your homework or not he might say ""Yes do your homework because if you dont you might get a bad grade"", and then you would have to pick which one is better for you. To conclude, if you realy need advice, you should ask multiple people so then you could get more ideas.",0
"""I just have no clue what to do!"" Generic_Name exclaimed. ""I don't like how Generic_Name has been treating me recently, and I heard all the horrible things she's said about me!"" she cried. ""Then get rid of her,"" Generic_Name scowled, ""Tell her you don't want to be friends with a liar."" ""Well I wouldn't want to hurt her,"" Generic_Name said with a tears rolling down her face. ""Who cares? She deserves it."" Generic_Name claimed, encouraging Generic_Name. ""Then it's settled, I will confront her tomorrow."" Generic_Name stated boldly. The next day, Generic_Name struts into school. She is like a solider ready for battle. Generic_Name stomps right up Generic_Name's locker and slams it shut. ""Hey! What was that for?"" Generic_Name questions. ""We are done being friends. I can't be around a liar and a cheat!"" Generic_Name snaps. ""Wh- What are you talking about?"" Generic_Name whimpers with tears in her eyes. ""I know you have been talking trgenGeneric_Name about me, and I'm done. I should've known. You have been jealous of me from the second we met at that dance center. I have always been better than you!"" Generic_Name says with a grin across her face. ""Generic_Name, we've been best friends since we were two. I would never do anything to hurt you."" Generic_Name sobs. ""Not anymore!"" Generic_Name shouts as she turns away. Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice is better because it will give you better judgment, help you see the other person's perspective, and could prevent you from saying hurtful things you might regret.

First off, talking to different people when seeking advice is better because it will give you better judgment. For example, if I thought that someone was being fake towards me, and I asked two different people, one might say to confront them, and one might tell me to ignore them. From there, I can decide which path to take. Secondly, a situation could be interpreted two totally different ways. For instance, one person might think that the person you are having an issue with meant to hurt you, and another might think it was an innocent mistake. My last reason is, after hearing multiple people talk about the situation at hand, you can decide which one is true to you. Picture this, two people tell me totally different ways to handle something, and I pick the non-confrontational one, this way I'm choosing to handle the situation my way. Overall, talking to different people can give you better judgment and clarity in the end.

Next, talking to multiple people can give you perspective. For instance, it could help you understand someone else's side of the story and what you're upset about may be false information. Furthermore, you could realize that the other person is the one that needs help. For example, if I am upset that someone has become distant with me, maybe it is because they are unhappy and want to be alone and it isn't your doing after all. Lastly, you have to understand how the other person feels in certain instances. Specifically, If someone came up to you and started screaming like at you like Generic_Name did, you would be upset too. In summary, talking to two or more people when seeking advice could help you understand the other person's mindset.

My last point is, talking to different people can prevent you from saying something you might regret. For example, in the story above, talking to two people would've stopped Generic_Name from calling Generic_Name those mean names. Secondly, people could take the mean things you say to heart and feel very offended. In fact, they could feel so upset that they start believe the things you said in spur of the moment. Finally, you could be saying all these mean things just because you are angry. In fact, 87% of things said in arguments aren't true, they just come from the anger in the moment. Therefore, you could just be angry at what this person did, so you say everything that is on your mind, instead of stepping away and biting your tongue.

Now let's look back on the beginning of the essay with Generic_Name and Generic_Name, but with our new outlook on asking for advice. ""I just have no clue what to do!"" Generic_Name exclaimed. ""I don't like how Generic_Name has been treating me recently, and I heard all the horrible things she's said about me!"" she cried. ""Then get rid of her,"" Generic_Name scowled, ""Tell her you don't want to be friends with a liar."" ""Well I wouldn't want to hurt her, I will probably talk with Generic_Name about it, I want to her advice too."" The next day, Generic_Name chats with Generic_Name at lunch. ""Hey Generic_Name, can I talk to you about something?"" Generic_Name says nervously.

""Sure, girl! You know I have your back no matter what,"" Generic_Name smiles. ""Well, Generic_Name has been treating me weird and I don't like it. People have been telling me she has been talking bad about me too,"" Generic_Name whimpers. ""Generic_Name, that's crazy. You guys have been friends forever.

Overall, talking to multiple people clearly was the better choice for Generic_Name, and it will always lead you to a more peaceful solution.",0
"Phones and Driving

People who are always driving and on their phone are a danger to the road. The police should crack down on the people who's doing it. In 2018 & 2019 there had been more deaths in the population has went up. Although cell phones have not been around very long and they have become a part of people life its like something very important. They use there people for uses like texting and talking and even playing games. The phones have develop over this and gain new features to them.

Using a hand held cellphone while driving is very dangerous to the person who's driving and to the other people who's on the road. Because it's very difficult for the driver to pay attention to the road. It's make the driver forget they there the only person driving on the highway. Other drivers take note about the other people who is doing this on the highway.

It can make people late for work if there's a car accident on the highway and it was the driver fault for being on there phone. You shouldn't want to risk your life our anyone else life just for a cell phone. They should make track phones for the people who uses them. It only will stop if the driver put a stop to it there self. A usage of a cell phone shouldn't be used on the road.

The cell phones have become an object where you can't keep it out your hand. However the dangers present themselves when they get behind the wheel. That's a bad habit for someone to have. Help other people stay on the road and drive safer.",0
"Studying Venus Remains a Worthy Scientific Pursuit

The author makes a compelling case that studying Venus remains a worthwhile scientific endeavor, in spite of the planet's challenging environment. Several key pieces of evidence support this claim.

One of the strongest arguments put forth is Venus's similarities to Earth. As the author notes, Venus is comparable in size and composition. It is closest in structure to our planet, with implications for understanding Earth's physical history and climate evolution. Even though surface conditions differ drastically today, Venus provides a lens into what can happen when a greenhouse effect spirals out of control. Insights gained about atmospheric dynamics and climate change processes have value as we work to address the same issues here. 

Logistical hurdles are acknowledged, but the author maintains they can be overcome. While the dense carbon dioxide atmosphere and intense heat pose clear dangers, exploration strategies outlined demonstrate how robotic probes may safely operate and analyze the Venusian environment. Prior missions have taught lessons that can enhance new design approaches. With dedicated engineering, the author is confident goals of investigating surface composition and activity can be achieved from orbit and even landed platforms.

In summary, the author presents a compelling case for continued Venus exploration despite risks. Strong scientific rationale is provided regarding comparative planetology and climate change. Feasible technical solutions are also proposed to enable more progressed understanding. While difficulties exist, the potential scientific rewards described support that studying Venus remains absolutely worthy as part of comprehensive solar system research. Careful mission planning can maximize productivity while minimizing hazards to craft and personnel. On the whole, the essay convinces the reader that Venus merits ongoing investigation.",1
"In recent years, the topic of sustainability has come to the forefront of public conversation. With global resources being depleted at an alarming rate, it is now more important than ever to find ways to live a sustainable lifestyle. The following essay will discuss some key aspects of living sustainably and how individuals can make changes in their own lives that help encourage sustainability for future generations. One way to promote sustainable habits is through reducing waste production and consumption overall. This means opting for reusable items when possible such as grocery bags or water bottles rather than disposable ones; using products with minimal packaging whenever you can; avoiding single-use plastics like straws and cutlery; and repurposing used materials like clothes or furniture instead of buying new items each time. Making small changes like these can greatly reduce your carbon footprint over time, helping ensure the planet's resources are preserved for future generations. Another part of living sustainably involves conserving energy by using renewable sources when available, such as solar or wind power, which release far fewer pollutants into the atmosphere than traditional fuel sources do. Additionally, choosing efficient household appliances lowers your utility bills while also minimizing environmental impact since they use less electricity per operation cycle compared to older models. Investing in energy-saving light bulbs and switching off lights when not needed are simple yet effective steps toward making our homes more energy-efficient too!. Finally, supporting local businesses is a great way to both contribute positively towards economic growth within one’s community while also creating fewer emissions from transportation due to shipping goods locally sourced instead of internationally shipped items - another example where taking small actions have large impacts on our environment! Shopping at farmer’s markets helps stimulate local agricultural production as well as give people access to fresh produce without having it travel long distances across countries before reaching them (another big reducer in greenhouse gases). All these factors combine together create a greater chance for us all working together towards making sure that we leave behind a

For those looking to be successful in multiple careers, research is essential. It takes a lot of effort to learn the skills needed and stay on top of ever-changing trends within each industry. In addition to research, a practical way to gain the necessary skills is to try a recipe or activity that you have never done before and practice it to perfect your skills. 

Experimenting with new things can often increase our self-confidence because we gain a sense of accomplishment in learning something new. Exploring and learning new activities can also help increase our knowledge and grow our skill sets. Additionally, failure can be seen as a learning opportunity, where we can take something away from the experience, while gaining the confidence to attempt such endeavours again. 

By studying the experiences of someone with multiple careers, it is possible to take away valuable information on how they managed to move between each different career and succeed. This knowledge can then be used to develop and form our own career plan. Nevertheless, it is essential to remember the importance of research and the willingness to experience something new in order to be successful in multiple careers.",1
"In recent years, it has become increasingly popular for people to lead a vegan lifestyle. As an ethical and healthy diet choice, veganism has been embraced by individuals from all walks of life who want to make more mindful food choices. Becoming a vegan is the perfect way to reduce the environmental impact of one’s diet while still being able to enjoy delicious meals with nutritious ingredients. One of the most important aspects of living a successful vegan lifestyle is finding easy, tasty recipes that contain only plant-based foods. While there are some pre-made options in stores and restaurants, cooking your own meals gives you full control over what you eat and allows you to get creative with flavors and textures. With some imagination and experimentation, vegans can create amazing dishes that everyone will love – even meat eaters!. Another key part of transitioning into veganism is learning about nutrition so that you don’t miss out on essential vitamins or minerals found in animal products. Fortunately, there are many fortified plant milks and other sources of calcium available nowadays which makes it easier than ever before to ensure adequate consumption of vital nutrients in a balanced meal plan. Additionally, substituting plants for animals when making traditional dishes like burgers can provide just as much protein as their original counterparts – if not more!. Living a healthy and ethical life as a vegan requires dedication but it can also be incredibly rewarding if done correctly; Not only do vegans have access to unique knowledge about nutrition but they also gain greater respect for the environment due to reduced reliance on animal agriculture practices which cause deforestation and pollution among other things. All this combined means that anyone considering becoming vegetarian should definitely give it try – especially since delicious recipes made with wholesome ingredients await those who take up this courageous endeavor!

"Nowadays, work is definitely more stressful than it was in the past. There are a few reasons for this. First of all, the economy is much more unstable now than it was in the past. This means that people are worried about losing their jobs, and they are working harder to try to keep their jobs. Secondly, there are more demands on people's time. With the advent of the internet and email, people are expected to be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This means that people have less time to relax and enjoy their leisure time. Finally, the pace of work has increased. With the pressure to do more with less, people are working faster and harder than ever before. This can lead to a lot of stress.

So, yes, work is more stressful than it was in the past. This can be a problem for people, as stress can lead to health problems. It is important for people to find ways to manage their stress, so that they can stay healthy and happy.

"Technology has changed the way we communicate over the last decade. With the rise of social media, communication has become more immediate and widespread than ever before. Through platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat, people can instantly share news or ideas with friends around the world in an instant. Despite its advantages for keeping us connected, this increased reliance on technology to communicate also has some negative effects. One of these is that interpersonal relationships have begun to suffer from our constant use of gadgets and devices. People updating their status every five minutes instead of reaching out to a trusted friend when they need emotional support; family members talking less during meals because they are texting someone else in another room - these are all common occurrences nowadays due to increased usage of digital communication tools. This lack of face-to-face interaction contributes to a decrease in meaningful conversations between people which could lead to feelings of disconnection and loneliness even among those surrounded by other people physically but not emotionally. Another effect that technology has had on communication is that it's made it easier for misinformation to spread quickly since anyone can create content without verifying whether it is true or false first; this leads many individuals being misinformed about important topics such as politics, health issues or other sensitive topics which would have previously been held up against more rigorous standards prior to publication in traditional media outlets like newspapers or television shows. In extreme cases this could lead public opinion and behaviour towards certain subjects based upon inaccurate information instead of facts and research which may result in long term damage if not corrected swiftly enough by reliable sources who crosscheck reports before distribution them widely via digital channels too. All things considered then while technology undoubtedly provides numerous benefits including faster access both information (and each other) sometimes at great distances apart however there are also several risks associated with relying so heavily upon digital communications that should be taken into account when objectively assessing how much time we spend online versus engaging directly with one another offline through sight conversation rather than virtual ones!

"All of these articles share the central idea of minimizing pollution where most of it comes from: cars. In the first source, they talk about how a city was created where cars are nonexistent, and people walk everywhere, a city called Vauban. This city is in Germany and consists of 5,500 people in a square mile area. Doing so in the creation of this city has cut down a major part of pollution in the surrounding area.

These methods of eradicating as much pollution as possible are making a substantial amount of progress, considering the densities of these cities and countries participating in this pollution expulsion effort. In Paris, France, they had an entire day where cars weren't allowed to be used in anyway or a massive fine would be administered. For the first day, people with even numbered license plates weren't allowed to drive, then the odd numbered the next day. Many people complained and didn't even go to work those days. Many trucking companies complained about a loss in revenue and being behind on work, and dozens of people were drastically fined. This did cut down on the amount of smog in Paris, though, and really cleaned out a lot of the city. It had gotten so bad in Paris that the pollution levels were around the ones in Bejing, the most polluted city in the world.

In Bogota, Colombia, driving was also banned for a day, but not because of high pollution levels in the area, but because the city feels they should do their part in helping the environment. Every year they set up a day when they won't drive, no matter rain, snow, any inconvience at all, is overlooked. They feel that the environment is more important than getting a little wet or being a little too cold, all of which are never permanent. The only form of carlike transport allowed was city buses, which even then weren't used very often besides by children or the elderly.

America is also doing their part in eliminating pollution, but are completely unaware of their doing so. The younger generation of America doesn't feel driving is at all of an imporance as other generations do. Many of these people don't have a drivers license and aren't planning on doing so for a long time. America has generally passed it's peak driving point in 2005 and is slowly decreasing in the purchase of cars, and drivers licenses.",0
"Limiting car usage is a great idea. If this ever does happen it will be a new Revolution for us all. Some might say that its outragious and unthinkable but it will benefit us in many ways. If we limit car usage there will be less polution, less stress, less traffic, more outside activities which means being healthier and last but not least it will be safer.

To begin with, with limited car usage there will be less polution and less stress. Most of our polution comes from cars, the smoke that the engine of the car lets out causes it. For example, Paris suffered a ""near-record pollution"" (source 2) due to the diesel. But after they enforced a fine of 22- euro ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France""(source 2). Don't you think that this is a positive outcome and this is benefiting us? Polution is a very important issue in the United States and we need to fix it or at least try. Now lets talk about stress, everybody has stress even if its from school, work, family ect. And everybody wants to have the least amount of stress as possible or no stress at all. If we limit the car use that will be taking a stress away from oneself, ""when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,""(source 1). Because that way parents dont have to worry whether their kids will get home safely. They wont have to worry about if they got into an accident, if after the pary they drived home intoxicated. Car accidents are very common in the United States and has caused many deaths so why not reduce that number,of deaths, and reduce car usage in the process? And not only for parents ,but elderly's as well  because some senior citizens still drive with or without license and that could cause a mayor incident.

Furthermore, by redusing car usage there will be more outdoor activities which means that it will be a lot more healthier. Think about it, by driving a car you dont exercise but if a person walks to a place, they are exersicing. For example, in German Suburb people have a limited car usage and you can hear the ""swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occassional distant motor""(source 1). The person could hear the outside activity and not the sound of cars passing by which means there was interaction between folks. Also, ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city...""(source 3) and isnt the government,especially Michelle Obama, trying to always give out messages of not only eating helathy but playing outside and interact with the community? well this is one way we can support that. Plus in this 21st century kids are always on their phones, tablets, computer and when they go out its to hang out with friends at the movies a party but they use cars. If the car usage is limited they wont have that many options and they could interact outside of their little ""bubble"". What ever way you look at this its gonna be a positive outcome even if its small.

Moreover, by reducing car usage there will be definetely less traffic and it will be a new beginning. To prove this points, in Bogota, Colombia ""million of Colombians hiked, biked, skated ot took buses to work during a car- free day yesterday, leaving the street of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (source 3). People hate traffic, it has not been known a person that doesnt. So, reducing car usage is equal to reducing traffic jams, why not do it then? Now it was never said  that there will be absolutely no cars just the decrease with it. There will be public transportations like taxis and buses but even if those where still be able to be used there wont be as much traffic. It is understandable that people sometimes need to get to places where you cant really walk to get there so the public transportation will be permitted. Also this will mean a ""new beginning"", Enrique Riera, mayor of Praguay said ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing boreders,"" (source 3). This statement says it all a ""revolutionary change"" its what we need. People are depending in cars so much and thats not good.

To end this thoughts, it is a great idea to limit the usage of cars. People will have one less thing to worry about and who woulnt like that huh? Also it will be healthy for the environment and the citizens and lets not forget, there will be less of a traffic jam. Plus it will be a big change but at the same time it wouldnt because statistics have shown that "" Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" (source 4). So it already started little by little we just have to accelerated the process a bit more.""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly  9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995"" (source 4),just think about all the positive outcomes of this change.",0
"Dear State Senator,

I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I believe in keeping the Electoral College for many reasons.

The Electoral College is not a place but a process that was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Each candidate running for president in a state has their own group of electors. A presidential election is held every four years so we can help choose our state's electors because when we vote for our candidate we actually are voting for our candidate's electors. Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office.

A single argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. At a very basic level, electoral college is unfair to voters. Mainly becuase of the winner-take-all system in each state. It is proven that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational but I strongly disagree. It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote but it rarely happens. I have five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree.

One is Certainty of Outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes, 538, is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. Second is Everyone's President. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised-to feel that their votes do not count and that the new president will have no regard for their interests. Third is Swing States. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012's election. Fourth is Big States. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. Fifth is Avoid Run-off Elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. An example is Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992. They both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes.

These are many reason I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

"Dear Senator,

The electoral college is a process that the founding fathers extablished as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and popular vote of the people. This process involves selecting the electors, meeting with the electors, and counting the votes by congress. There are 538 electors total in the Electoral College. The presidential election happens every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. After the election the governor makes a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which has all the names of the candidates who ran for President. I believe we should keep the Electoral College because there is a certainty of outcome, it helps avoid run-off elections, and the electoral college helps balance out the smaller and bigger states with more people that vote.

The outcome of an Electoral College has a possibility of creating a dispute like in 2000, but this dispute is less likely to happen over a dispute over the popoular vote. This is because the winning candidates share of the Electoral College is greater than his share of the popular vote. Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote in comparison to the 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Mitt Romney. Trans-regional appeal is required in the Electoral College. If we got rid of the Electoral College then there would be a greater possibility of dispute.

Furthermore, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the Electoral College. This proves that the Electoral college avoids the problems of elections in which neither candidate receives a majority of the votes. When no candidate wins a majority the pressure complicates the presidential election process. The Electoral College minimized this pressure be invariably producing a clear winner every time. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.

In addition, a large state gets more attention from candidates than a small sate in a campaign. As an example in 2012 Obama, got 29 electoral votes. In Wyoming the winner only had 2 electoral votes in the same marin as Obama. The Electoral College provides some kind of restoration for the weight in the political balance that large states lose by mal-apportionment of the Senate. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to read into and pay more attention to a campaign because they know they are going to decide the election. It is most likely that these people are going to the the most thoughtful voters.

To conclude, there are many reasons to keep the Electoral College. This process has made the winner of the election much clearer to decide. There are a lot of pros and cons to the Electoral College but the list of cons is way shorter than the list of all the pros to the Electoral College. We should keep the Electoral College because it creates a certainty of outcome, diminishes run-off elections, and creates a balance for the bigger states. The Electoral College has created a positive impact for our presidential election.

"The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005. From there, it steadily dropped to, as of April 2013, nine percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. This decrease has had positive effcts, though. Limiting car usage saves time, improves safety, conserves resources, and causes more social interactions with people.

Recent studies suggest the Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Still, in places like paris, cars are still causing polution. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Because of this ban, congestion went dow 60 percent in the capital of France. By haveing fewer cars out on the streets, it lowers rates of traffic and the time it takes people to get to work. Also, in result of a decrease in traffic, there would be less accidents and less lives lost to motorvehicle collisions.

France's tax policy that favors diesel fuel over gasoline results in higher percent of people using diesel vehicles. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engins in the rest of Western Europe. By cutting back on car usage, the world would save an astronomical amount of resources. If people stopped bying cars, there would be less production of them. Thus conserving the metal, as well as other materials, used to make the cars.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdent streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. Sitting in a car to get to work, or any where in fact, restricts how much interaction you have with other people. By walking, or even taking public transportation, you get the chance to run into people you know or meet new people.

Time saving, improvement on safety, conservation of resources, and more social face-to-face interactions can be accomplished by limting car usage. The decrease in the percentage of miles driven in the United States from 2005 to 2013 proves that people are starting to understand this. If the pattern persists--and many sociologists believe it will--it will have benificial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment as well.",0
"The Challenge of Exploring Venus as the author suggested to study is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it can happen. The reason Humens should explore the Unknown Venus is becuase it was the closest planet to Earth terms of density and size. Venus is dangers for a humen to explore but not an unman spacecraft to go near the surface. Venus is tricky and challanging to explore becuase of the high temeratures that average 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Even though Mercury is the closet to our sun.

On the depths of the surface of Venus there is alot going on, as in erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightign strikes. Scientists are already discussing how to visit the Venus surface which means they also want to explore and study Venus. Venus once have been like Earth-like planet in our solar system. It has some land features if rocky sediment, Valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus is sometimes our nearest option for a planetary visit, given the long time frames of space travel. The Value of returning to venus seems unlikly.

NASA is creating a blimp-like vehicle to hover 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. The almost easy task for the vehicle would use solar power becuase the sun would be above it all the time. Even in high altitude the climate is still pretty hot that is around 170 degree Fahrenheit. The downfall to being so high up above 30 or more miles is not much research will go on becuase the limited view we well get. More importantly is that scientist can't get samples of rocks, gases, and anything else since the spacecraft will be high up.

Scientist is now looking at old technology called mechanical computers. The ""old Technology"" uses gear and levers but not electronics at all. Modern computers are more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. mechanical parts are more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces then a computer. What I think is that Venus is worth the pursuit despite the danger it can bring. Venus does have value to be explored because who doesn't love a challenge? I sure do love a challenge.",0

First impressions can have a lasting impact, and in many instances they are almost impossible to change. This is because we tend to use first impressions as benchmarks in forming an opinion about someone or something. As a result, first impressions can shape our future interactions and experiences with them. 

To illustrate the effects of first impressions, I’ll use an example from my own life. As a freshman in high school, I was excited to join the basketball team. Upon entering the gym for the team’s first practice, I was surprised to find that I already had a negative reputation among some of my teammates. At first, I couldn’t understand why they were so skeptical about me, but then I realized that my reputation was based on a poor first impression. Unbeknownst to me, my teammates had already judged me based on my physical appearance and the fact that I was new to the team. Despite the fact that I worked extremely hard to gain their trust and admiration, I found that it was a losing battle due to my poor first impression. 

These experiences have taught me that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Despite our best efforts, those who make an unimpressive first impression often find that subsequent efforts to shake the initial perception are simply not enough. As a result, first impressions can have a lasting impact and it’s important to make a good one when you meet someone for the first time.",1

Rachel’s story is a great example of what one can achieve when they put in the hard work and effort, even if it means experiencing failure along the way.

The entrepreneurial journey of Warby Parker is another great example.

"The world of fashion has been around for centuries and continues to evolve in modern times. Designers have continually adapted and changed their styles over the years, but one trend that seems to remain constant is the use of vintage clothing. Vintage clothing is defined as apparel from a past era or decade, usually characterized by its classic style and unique detailing. Whether it's a piece of couture from the 1940s or an old-school t-shirt at a thrift store, vintage clothes are always on trend with fashionistas today. When shopping for vintage items, there are some factors you should consider before making your purchase. First and foremost is quality – look carefully at how well made the item is; if it’s too worn out or damaged beyond repair then you may want to keep searching for something better! Next comes condition – make sure any blemishes such as stains don’t detract too much from the overall look of the garment (unless you like that kind of thing). Finally check for originality – many stores now offer “vintage inspired” pieces which aren’t actually true relics from past decades so do some research beforehand to ensure what you buy is authentic. In addition to providing some amazing garments full of character and history, buying secondhand also helps promote sustainability in fashion which can be very beneficial in reducing landfill waste generated by discarded clothing each year. Shopping this way also guarantees uniqueness since no two items will ever be exactly alike - think about all those cool one-of-a-kind looks you can create! Furthermore opting for recycled fabric often means saving money due to lower price tags associated with used garments compared to new ones so it really pays off in more ways than one!. No matter where your style influences come from - whether its vogue magazines or Instagram influencers - incorporating some vintage elements into your wardrobe not only adds diversity but demonstrates knowledge about current trends while showing appreciation for historical fashions gone

"first of all I'm going to argue about changing election by popular vote for the president of the United States. the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting the a president that out to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense.

Second off, but each party, selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)...[;however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet it happens rarely. Also there are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or coservative reasons.

Thirdly, a dispute over the outcomes of an Electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dipute over the popular vote. The reason is the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. in [ 2012's] election, for example obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because almost all staes award electoral votes on a winner-take-all-basis, even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide of electoral-vote victory in theat state.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the problem of election in which no candidates recives a majority of votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoal votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presendential elections process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.",0
"Have you ever felt stuck when writing an essay, like you just can't move on from a sentence. Not knowing how to continue something your writing is normal. Everybody at one point or another doesn't know how to get past a sentence or two. How to get past it, is by getting multiple opinions. Getting multiple opinions on a topic gives you different viewpoints, it shows that you are open to new ideas, and it shows that you are able to rely on others.

When writing something, getting a different point of view can always make your essay better. Before starting your essay, you should always look at the two (or more) view points. As long as you know which side your essay is about you won't get lost when writing. When given multiple viewpoints, always address the other side somewhere in your essay. Whether its at the beginning or end of an essay or speech, addressing both sides show how committed you are to the topic and it means that people can't question whether or not you even considered the other side. If you're ever not sure which side you agree with, than list the pros and cons of each side. This will show how much you already know about each viewpoint, and what you need to research about.

If you're ever stuck on an essay asking others opinions can lead you to new ideas. Whenever I'm stuck on a essay or project I ask a friend, parent, or teacher for help. I show them what I have, and they give me advise on what parts that I can fix and things can be better. If someone says something that you think would be a good idea but you don't know when or how to use, write it down! No one is saying you have to use every piece of advice given to you, but make sure to at least write it down on a piece of paper, it might come in handy later. Asking for others opinions can give you some ideas for a better essay.

Asking others for their opinions show that you are able to ask for assistance. If you don't know something asking others show you're able to admit that you need help. Most people when they get stuck just sit there and won't even ask questions to other people. By doing this, they're saying that they would rather do poorly on the assignment, rather than admit their stuck. Asking a question doesn't mean you aren't smart either. It actually means you're smart enough to know when you need an outside opinion. When someone is giving you advice, even if you don't ask them too, don't act mean or snooty. This makes people not want to help you, and it doesn't work out for you in the long run.

Asking others for advice gives you different view points, new ideas, and shows that you can ask for assistance. Willing to get advice makes you look more like a team player to your colleges or fellow students, teachers, and employers. Taking advice will also give whatever you're working on something more. However, if you rely on other people to give you ideas, you might not be able to come up with your own ideas. As long as you know how to work on your own, you'll be good. So, I implore you to ask questions when you need it and get different viewpoints on the topic too, so your project will be the best it can be.",0
"New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.

This technology does sound helpful in the fact that it could gauge the state of mind of a student and help a teacher adjust their teaching methods to accomodate and keep their students students on track. The article did state that the techonology could identify when a student is ""confused or bored"" and then ""modify the lesson"" to keep a student engaged. In this way, the technology is useful in the fact that it adapts to the needs of the student. But what can this program do that a teacher's survey could not? By the way the article talks about how a ""home PC can't handle the complex algorithms"" and about how complex the system is, it makes people wonder just how much this system would cost and how complicated it would be to enstate said system into a classroom. Compared to a quick survey done by a teacher who asks their students how they feel about their methods of teaching, it is seen how the system would be a waste of recourses and money. Therefore, although this system is useful in the fact that it can gauge the emotions of the students, it is not much more useful than a teacher who can do the same thing by questioning their students on their preferences and ideas.

Also, although technology is very much improved in these years, it is still not always accurate and infallible, and therefore may not be suitable for a classroom. The article states that the technology associates each emotion with ""characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a ""false smile"", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.

Lastly, if the physical problems of the technology have not already been offputting, then maybe the moral problem of this technology will sway opinions against using it in a classroom. If this technology really can ""indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"", then this means it can invade people's privacy and indicate an emotion which a person is trying to hide. If a student is feeling sad or feeling stressed about home problems which they are trying to conceal, then the technology detects this and displays it for the teacher and the electronic lesson to see. This is an invasion of privacy, as the teacher does not need to know about a student's homelife or about their feelings outside the classroom. A teachers job should be to monitor how their students are feeling about their lessons, not about how their students are feeling about their life outside of school, and since this technology could pick up on digressing feelings, it should not be used in a classroom where a student's internal feelings are revealed to a teacher. Therefore, using Facial Action Coding could end up being an invasion of privacy that should not be introduced to the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System is a bad idea for the classroom, as it could incorrectly read a student's emotions and give a misleading output that puts a student off track in their education, and also because it could invade a student's privacy of their inner mind. Therefore, installing this system in schools would be a waste of money and recourses, especially when teachers can gauge how their students are learning by simply asking their students in an anonymous survey how they feel about their teaching methods. In this society, technology is used to fix almost everything, but in this case, scientists should quit trying to force technology on behavioral issues and just let humans interact so they can benefit themselves with communication, no computerized middleman needed.",0
"Successful people are not afraid to try new things and take risks. They know that in order to achieve great things, they need to be willing to step outside their comfort zone.

For example, when Bill Gates first started Microsoft, he took a risk by betting his entire savings on the company. And it paid off – Microsoft became one of the most successful tech companies in the world.

Another example is Elon Musk. He is the founder of Tesla, SpaceX, and several other startups. He is constantly trying new things and taking risks, even though many of his ventures have failed in the past. But he doesn’t let that stop him – he just keeps trying new things until he finds something that works.

Successful people know that if they want to achieve great things, they need to be willing to take risks. They know that there is no such thing as failure – only learning experiences. And they are not afraid to try new things, even if they don’t know how to do them yet.

So if you want to be successful, don’t be afraid to try new things and take risks. It may be scary at first, but it will be worth it in the end.

"The advantages of limiting car usage are less air pollution. Less smog would be intensifying in other countries. more people would be released from the stress of owning a car people wouldnt have to worry about gas prices. The rate of car accidents would go down and so would the percentage of deaths caused by car accidents. more money would be saved since less people wont have to worry about spending any money repairing their vehicles or tuning them up.

Crime rates would decrease since less ppl would be able to commit crimes without a car,and no one could have their car stolen from them. Teen deaths caused by drunk driving would decrease as well. The cost of emissions would go down imensly and the U.S would gain alot more money because of less money spent on vehicles and and imports and gas,oil,tires and other vehicle related cost expenses. Limiting car usage is one of the best possible thing U.S American citizens can do to help preserve our earth and its enviorment.

It is best if everyone start to limit their car usage so that our planet can be less polluted and can be smog free. Cars are one of the biggest reasons for air pollution and we spend alot of money and them aswell. So i believe car usage should be limited for the greater good of our earth.",0
"The Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that helps know the emotions the person is feeling. This new technology can even identify emotions from a painting as old as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. This technology can also identify when there are mix emotions and when one is faking or lying about it. It all happens by how the muscles of our face move which show a specific emotion or more. The Facial Action Coding System is indeed very valuable because it could help a speaker's performance, performance in the arts, and to know the truth.

This new technology could help a speaker's performance by knowing how he is doing. If the speaker is reading off a long paragraph and the listeners are ""paying attention"" but in reality are thinking about something else then the speaker would know. He would then be able to involve the listeners in his speech, make eye contact or do whatever to get thier attention back. This could benefit teachers in a daily lesson to know how good or bad they are doing at explaining things. It could help when preparing for the end of the semester test and then the teacher would know what to focus on. This could also help when student's are giving speeches infront of the class. They would be able to know if they are doing a good job or not and how to do better in their speech to get a better grade.

In theater you have to act as a different person and you have to get into there position in whatever situation they are in. You can't just read the lines and expect people to enjoy the play. You have to be sad when your best friend died or scared when some is chasing after you. All of these are emotions that the teacher would expect performers to perform. This is why the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable to better the perfomance in arts. In paragraph 9 the author states ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" This means that the new technology can make those fake emotions into more realistic for actors who need to seem like they are actually scared, sad, worried or feeling any other emotion.

Furthermore in paragraph 8 it says ""these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This means that the new technology could help know if the emotions public people are showing is actually truthful or not. If they are faking to be sad about something tragic but in reality they aren't then that would show everyone who they really are. Even though this is invading people's personal opinion and space, it would help to know the truth. This could also cause problems in the world of politics but it's better to be honest than to lie. Everyone deserves to know the truth about politics and what they really think so it would not hurt to know the very truth.

Don't you think that it's better to be honest with yourself and everyone else then faking things? This new technology Facial Action Coding System would helping with that. It could help a speaker's performance by knowing if they are explaining it right. It could help in acting an emotion different from what they are truly feeling. Lastly, it could help with knowing the whole truth about politicians and there way of showing they think about certain things. These are only three reasons why this new technology would be valuable.",0
"Cell Phones While Driving

Most People, not if all have cell phones in today's society. Cell phones have not been around for a very long time but they are a key part of our lives. We use cell phones for everything we do day to day such as Texting, Talking, Gaming. Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. Cell phones help effectively and without wasting any time in making direct contact with the person.

It is observed that the use of mobile phones during driving, despite an effective means of communication, contributes to an interruption of the driver's attention which increases issues concerning road safety. Drivers that use cell phones could never pay full attention to roads that expose not only themselves but also other people on the road. The research team's results showed that the use of cell phones makes drivers quite exposed to serious crashes while driving. The driver's main emphasis is not on the road or traffic, and even at one time trying to handle the phone and vehicle becomes difficult. During driving, cell phones also reduce drivers' mental capacity, as they fail to focus on minor or major activities that occur around them. Drivers that use cell phones respond slowly and very often make wrong decisions that can trigger fatal accidents affecting other passenger cars. Driving decision making is a vital factor in giving drivers a split second to make a fast decision.

Although there are serious negative impacts of using cell phones while driving, it is also relevant to present advantages for the sake of arguments. The security factor is again the most important benefit of cell phones during driving. Cell phones can provide help during emergencies and drivers can make emergency calls, even reporting any hazardous scenarios such as roadside accidents. A driver can locate the desired route via cell phones. Besides, any use of FMs on cellular phones may provide weather and traffic information. Cell phones help effectively and without wasting any time in making direct contact with the person. There are other ways to distract a driver than cell phones such as talking to passengers, cigarette lighting and smoking, eating, drinking, emergencies presented justifications from both sides of an issue using cell phones during driving, and not using them.

The paper raised points on both sides of the issue using mobile phones while driving, or not using them. I proposed that using cell phones is very dangerous while driving a vehicle because they cause you to lose your distraction while driving and they can cause a serious accident. But as well as that they are good for emergency purposes.",0
"The value of a good education is one of the most important aspects of success in life. While there are some people who have achieved incredible things without having gone to college, the majority of successful people owe at least some part of their success to the advantages that come from having earned a degree. The educational system has been changing and evolving for hundreds of years, but it still remains an essential part of our lives because it provides so many opportunities for personal growth and professional advancement. For instance, obtaining a degree allows individuals to develop higher-level thinking skills such as analytical problem solving and research techniques—essential attributes in today’s tech-driven world. Education also encourages creativity and innovation by teaching students how to think outside the box instead of just regurgitating information found online or memorizing answers out of textbooks. People with degrees usually have better job prospects than those without them because employers seek workers who can demonstrate superior knowledge on various topics related to their field. In addition, educated professionals tend to earn higher salaries since they possess extensive experience backing up their qualifications and skillsets. Education also exposes us to different cultures, values systems, religions, political views—all invaluable assets when striving for personal understanding or making informed decisions about global events and issues affecting our society today. A quality education helps build character traits such as integrity which are vital for social interaction within businesses or communities around the world; learning experiences provide valuable stories (both positive and negative) which serve as lessons throughout adulthood—especially when leading others or working collaboratively towards common goals/objectives across multiple teams/divisions within organizations worldwide. In conclusion, obtaining an education is more than just getting into college or university; it is an investment in oneself which will continue paying dividends over time due its ability to sharpen critical thinking abilities while encouraging creative problem solving strategies among other practical benefits associated with being well versed in diverse topics areas relevant within any given profession - all qualities necessary for career success!

"Phones & Driving

Communication has progressed from the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 to the endless communication that is now available in the 21st century, but it has come at a price. People's need for communication, specifically with cell-phones has created the serious issue of cell-phone use while driving. This issue leads to serious consequences, and has been met with new laws and features added to cars to keep the roads safe from cell-phone use while driving.

This issue has caused various accidents and sometimes deaths. The distraction that cell-phones create while driving has the ability to seriously injure or even take someone's life away. For many years, while most states have not had laws regulating cell-phone use while driving, there have been various PSA campaigns warning against cell-phone use while driving, usually specific with texting and driving. These PSAs are meant to scare drivers hoping that it will discourage this dangerous behavior.

These distracted drivers are usually texting to reply to someone, using their satellite navigation system on their phone, or could be adjusting their music through their phone. These behaviors have been specifically targeted by many states that have enacted laws to prevent cell-phone use that can cause accidents. Georgia, specifically, passed the hands-free rule, fining drivers for cell-phone use, holding the phone. This law can be easily obeyed because of the adjustments created by car companies and other accessories that are available. More recent cars have options for phones through the car to keep the driver focused on the road but keeping the communication possible for the driver. Cars may have an aux cord or a bluetooth option to be able to receive and make calls without touching the phone. Phones connected to the car this way, can play music through a cell-phone through the car, then the driver can control volume and choice of song through the steering wheel. There are many car accessories to make phone use safer like an attachment to the windshield that holds the driver's phone, to keep their eyes in the front to the road rather than to the side to look at their phone. These adjustments that coincide with laws like the hands-free rule allow drivers to safely use their cell-phones while driving.

This issue has lead to serious consequences, and has been met with new laws and features added to cars to keep the roads safe from cell-phone use while driving, but will continue to have serious consequences. While there are many solutions to this issue have been created it will still have consequences. People will continue to be injured or killed by this issue but without any restrictions or inventions this issue would not continued at the same rate. The precautions keep the roads as safe as they can be, because people will continue to use their cell-phones while driving, but at least it is more regulated and less distracting now.",0
"Have you seen venus in the sky while your star gazing? although venus is often refered to as ""earth's twin"", it is challenging to explore. venus is one of the more challenging planets to explore for a couple of reasons. those reasons are, the caron monoxide, sulfuric asid, andand the severe temperatures.

venus is covered with a thick blanket of carbon monoxide. this is one of the reasons that makes it very dangerouse to go there. based on the article ""the challenge of exploring venus"", venus has "" a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon monoxide"" .this mutch carbon monoxide is very dangerouse.

the even more chalenging part is the sulferic acid.

the clouds on venus are filled with sulferic acid. not only is that dangerouse but the sulferic acid is,""highly corrosive"". highly corrosif is almost like saying flamable.

and if the sulferic acid wasnt dangerouse/hot but the temperatuer alone is enough to kill you. here on earth we experience heat but on venus the heat is extreme. in the article it states, ""on the planets surface ,temperatures average over 800 degrees farenhieght""

if you were wanting to try making it, good luck, but based on the information it seems like it is not recomended. so stay home on earth. enjoy the fresh air and life that awaits you. it is to dangerouse to waste your time on.",0
"Grocery Shopping During the COVID-19 Pandemic has been a Challenging Experience. The coronavirus pandemic has changed many aspects of our lives, one of them being grocery shopping. Most supermarkets have had to introduce new safety measures in order to protect everyone as much as possible and make sure customers can shop safely. The entire process of grocery shopping during this period is quite different compared to pre-pandemic times. To start with, it's almost impossible not to notice that there are staff members managing queues outside stores and controlling the number of shoppers inside at any given time. This measure is necessary in order to avoid overcrowding, which could lead to higher risks of contagion. Moreover, once inside the store most supermarkets require customers wear masks covering their nose and mouth at all times; some even provide disposable gloves if needed by shoppers. These extra restrictions were implemented in order for people to feel safer while buying food or other items they need from the store. . Another noticeable difference when going food shopping today versus before covid-19 has been introduced is that most stores are constantly sanitized throughout the day; on top of that there are hand sanitizer stations located around each aisle as a reminder for customers that hygiene should be taken seriously during these times . What’s more interesting about this situation is how customer service representatives interact with clients: instead of helping people directly like before , now those employees guide individuals towards certain products using body language , signs or just pointing out what’s needed ; but still keeping a safe distance between both parties . In addition, self checkout machines became more popular over these last few months since it eliminates contact between cashiers and customers making everyone feel protected against potential contagions . . All these changes made grocery shopping during Covid-19 an overwhelming experience , however taking into consideration its current importance it shouldn't come as surprise how strict safety protocols have become when dealing with such matters .

"There have been many question going around about a face shaped rock that was recently found on Mars. Many think that it was aliens, but I mean those are just conspiracy theories. There's no real evidence but either way I'm here to clarify what the face is. I have gotten information form the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"".

First of all, the Face is being used for people to believe it's a misterious object. Ever since the Face was discovered it has become a pop icon. The article I found said ""The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and has even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years."" The article also said ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" The only people that are saying anything about the Face and if it's made by aliens are conspiracy theorists.

Also, NASA has captured better pictures but people still believe it was aliens. An article said ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousand of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The article also said ""What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms commom around the American West."" NASA took clear picture of the landform and found out that it's just a landform.

Although, the second time NASA took the pictures it was cloudy, so they could be trying to hide something. The text said ""But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98, a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" So NASA could be trying to hide something by taking the pictures during the time when there's that type of weather.

However, NASA wouldn't lie about this kind of discovery because it would also be very helpful for them. The text said ""We felt this was important ot taxpayers,"" explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. ""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" The article also said ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height and the Face on Mars."" The Face isn't made by aliens or anything of that sort. Even if people wanted to it to be something the Face is just a landform.

In conclusion, the Face is just a landform it's not an alien artifact or anything else. The only people saying it was made by aliens are conspiracy theorists. The Face is just a landform that had the perfect lighting to make it look like a face. I know conspiracy theorists think it's something else but the information and facts are clearly stated.",0
"Why do scientists want to persue going to Venus? Is it the curiosity? Is it that they think they have found a possible substitute to Earth? In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author claims that even thoug it may be dangerous to do, visiting venus is a worthy persuit. The reasons that the author states in the article are: Astronomers are fascinated by the planet, human curiosity, and because NASA is already planning it.

The first reason why the author said that the mission to Venus should be looked at is because astronomers are fascinated by Venus. They are fascinated because they believe that Venus is the closes thing to Earth, not only by distance but also because they are very similar. In paragraph 4 it is stated that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". So they want to discover and see if Venus still has the Earth like qualities to it.

Furthermore, the other reason the author gave as to why scientists are so interested in persuing the visiting to Venus is because humans are ery curious and because they think that the curiosity will lead to many things. On paragraph 8, the author explains that ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally untimidating endeavors"" meaning that might as well trying it since we are going to try far worse stuff in the future.

Lastly, NASA already is planning to send people to research Venus, of course, they are taking many precautions and they are simulating the things that astronauts might face when they get there or near there. ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow to float abov the fray"" as stated on paragraph 5, it would still be hot but they would be able to handle it. As they describe it ""Not easy conditions, but survuvable for humans""

In conclusion, the author gave some strong points as to why they think that the studying of Venus should be persuaded. They also gave a lot of information and supporting details to their claims.",0
"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that are becoming increasingly apparent in various areas of the world. One of the key benefits of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which is crucial in combating climate change. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and this number can be even higher in certain areas of the United States. By reducing car usage, we can effectively decrease these emissions and contribute to a healthier and more sustainable environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can also lead to a more efficient and organized urban planning. In the German suburb of Vauban, for example, streets are completely car-free, except for a few main thoroughfares. This design encourages residents to use alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, or public transit. Placing stores within walking distance and creating accessible public transportation systems are also part of this approach. By adopting this model, suburbs become more compact, reducing the need for extensive parking spaces and encouraging a more efficient use of land.

In addition to reducing emissions and promoting efficient urban planning, limiting car usage can also have positive health impacts. The passage about Bogota's car-free day highlights the benefits of promoting alternative transportation for both individuals and communities. People who participate in such events experience a decrease in stress levels and have the opportunity to engage in physical exercise by biking or walking. Moreover, by reducing the number of cars on the road, air pollution is decreased, providing cleaner air for everyone.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential economic benefits it can bring. The passage mentions how delivery companies complained of lost revenue during the driving ban in Paris. However, these short-term setbacks can be outweighed by long-term economic gains. For example, investing in public transportation systems and alternative modes of transportation can create jobs in industries such as construction, maintenance, and operation of these systems. Additionally, by reducing the reliance on personal vehicles, individuals can save money on fuel, parking fees, and car maintenance.

While there may be concerns about the impact of limiting car usage on car manufacturers, it is important to recognize that the shift away from car culture represents a larger cultural shift. Younger generations are showing less interest in car ownership, instead choosing alternative ways of getting around, such as using public transportation or car-sharing programs. Car companies are also adapting by rebranding themselves as mobility companies, offering a range of transportation services beyond personal cars.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and varied. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions to promoting efficient urban planning, improving public health to potentially boosting the economy, limiting car usage has far-reaching benefits. By adopting models like the car-free suburb of Vauban in Germany or implementing car-free days like in Bogota, cities and communities can work towards a more sustainable and livable future.",1
"When it comes to music, few instruments can match the iconic sound of a saxophone. With its smooth and soulful tones, the saxophone has been a mainstay in popular music for nearly 150 years. In that time, the instrument has seen use in genres ranging from jazz to rock and roll, funk to hip-hop, making it an essential part of any musician’s toolkit. The modern saxophone was invented by Adolphe Sax in 1846. Since then, many notable musicians have taken up the instrument and used it to craft unforgettable sounds - artists like John Coltrane and Charlie Parker are just two famous examples of generations of great players who have enriched our lives with their contributions on this remarkable instrument. Though often thought of as primarily a solo jazz or blues instrument today, the range of possibilities offered by playing a sax makes it attractive across multiple genres. From traditional classical composers utilizing its full range within chamber orchestras; to storied pop acts such as Earth Wind & Fire's ""Serpentine Fire"" featuring Michael Brecker's blazing solo; there is no shortage of exciting moments when listening for what a talented player can do with electronics effects pedals alongside more conventional techniques. In addition to its musical capabilities and versatility across styles, one important aspect that sets apart the sax from other woodwind instruments include its unique physicality: players must use their entire body while performing – legs shifting weight onto either side while moving around during improvisation sections; arms extending outward into wild gestures while they hit high notes; head leaning back dramatically at key points – all these actions are components behind bringing alive whatever vision someone may have inside their mind before even beginning down this journey!. . It’s easy to see why so many people choose the saxophone as their go-to instrument when wanting express themselves musically – whether through improvisation or learning complex compositions faithfully - but ultimately each individual will find something special in taking on this

"Driving at times can be a really big issue to deal with. There are so many thing that can go wrong, a crash, then increase in insurance, you might even get your license taken away after that. When you don't drive, the world is an open book just waiting to be read. Walking or riding bikes can relieve stress and make you more fit and in shape. The gasses that come from cars are just aweful for the environment, and there would be such a largly reduced number in traffic jams if people would just get off the road. Once your on the road, anything can happen. It's dangerous, i sometimes even wonder if i really want a license.

When you drive there are so many traffic jams. The idea of never having to worry about traffic again is intriguing. Why worry about having to rush through traffic just to get to work on time, when instead you can simply manage your time correctly and walk at the pace you are comfortable with. Traffic jams cause accidents that put peoples lives at risk. In the article, ""Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in booga"" by Andrew Selsky, he states, ""...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"". The carfree day in Colombia is working to perfection to promote alternative transportation, i don't see why we dont have this in the United States.

driving causes stress and tension and that's never good. A stressed driver is a dangerous driver, when you're stressed you become more careless and less aware of your surroundings and that is very dangerous as a driver it leads to reckless driving and accidents. Being without a car relieves this stress for many people. In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a quote from the article states, ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. This shows that cars are a lot to handle and that most people just believe it is too much stress for one person to deal with.

The smog and pollution caused by all the cars that are on the road these days is another reason why it is best to stay off the road. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, he says, ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". The cities ban on cars on the road shows a serious concern in the saftey of the people because of all the smog that driving has caused.

Some people might argue that cars would be faster, but if you take a car you are going to be mor at risk of an accident, you're going to be polluting the air, and you'll only be stressing yourself out in the process. I strongly suggest that America does something to change our ways, because if we don't, we'll end up like Beijing and Paris with an extremly high pollution rate.",0
"As a u. s citizen that we should get rid of the ellectoral college. I think that it should be the peoples desision of who should run the countrys main power. Being the president is the biggest job in america so i think it should be up to the people that will have to obide by his rules and follow his laws. It would not be fair if all the higher richer people get to decide cause they can all decide the one in their favor thats helps them out the most and all lower class people would be screwed. Some may think that the Electoral college is a better choice because their is different benifits about the electors voting instead of americas people. Like for instance when their are ties the ellectoral college is a huge help.

The popular vote is the best way to do it as long as the restrictions are being followed ,like no voting til you are 18 years of age and no fellonies policy. These rules can be very important to the elections concidering that would get rid of millions of extra votes. In the electoral college one thing i do not like is the fact each state has a different number of electoral votes. that would favor one state more than another rather than them all having an equal amount so the voting could be more justified and fair.",0
"The Election System should be changed to popular vote. The Electoral College is unfair and irrational. It should be cancelled, and be based upon popular vote with numbers that make since. Many votes have been barely won because the numbers are so close and high. The Electoral College Isn't an amount of how many people voted for a president, its for an elector. And you dont always pick your elector, it could get confused and a wrong elector could get picked.

Many states do not have a fair chance to vote, And one representative can count as too many votes compared to their own value. Sates that didnt have the chance to see the candidates were most likely ignored with docent help because even if the people guessed a vote the electors would give out a large number of votes randomly to a candidate. Some staes didnt even get so see an ad for the candidates once.

""A single representative from wyoming representing five hundred thousand representatives would have as much to say as fifty five representatives from California, who represent thirty five million voters."" "" During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt get to see the candidates at all,Including rhode island and south carolinia, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad."" These qoutes from bradford plumber, explain that half of the peoples votes were going to wrong candidates as the pepole were completley confused about who they were even voting for. They didnt even get Ads that could give them at least a look or a hint, basically, the people were clueless. It even seems a little unorganized, the Electoral College docent make much since either based on the information given, but what you should really think about is how the Electoral College has hint of trying to cheat its way into electing a candidate.

In addition, The voters are left with an unfair outcome at almost every election because of the Electoral Collage. The votes can either be very close or the people could miss Ads or campaigns for candidates, leaving the people with nothing and confusion all over. Even if you knew what elector you voted for, you cant necessarily pick who it is your voting for and your vote could possibly get confued giving you a bad outcome. Most elections are just slid by and are just based on what ever the Electoral College thinks should happen. So please abolish the Electoral College its is irrational and is not neccessary, let the people really have a fair chance.",0
"Drivers Should Not Be Able To Use Cell Phone In Any Capacity While Operating A Vehicle

How many of you have been in a car accident? Now how many of you have used your phone while behind the wheel of a car? Imagine looking down checking a text message for a second then you look up and BOOM. Research shows cell phones are the leading cause of motor vehicle accidents in teens. Everyday people die in car accidents because they use their phone while driving.

Some argue due to their occupation they have to always be available to answer the phone. However, work can be stressful and while driving possibly dangerous. Resulting from an upsetting conversation you may be distracted and may lower your driving ability. Checking one text message could end your life in an instant. Mind you teens are still in the mist of officially learning how to drive properly. Cell phones are an obvious distraction and will prohibit you from doing so.

For example, October 18, 2013 was the day a 17 year old teenager named Sydnee Williams lost her life. She was driving when she made the decision to pick up her phone and text while driving. Williams was not wearing a seatbelt and was ejected from the car after crashing. Two days later sadly succumb Sydnee to her injuries and passed away. Though she was the only person in the car her life was not the only one that ended that day.

Texting while driving is completely illegal in 47 states as well as Washington D.C. Fines can range from $20 to up to $500 depending on the state. Other states this action can result in criminal misdemeanor charges. If the offense has resulted in a bodily injury to another person prison or jail time may be imposed. Not only are you putting your life in danger but possibly others. Now do u think jail time is worth replying to a text that could have waited.

In conclusion we don't want to lose another life because cell phones. They are a distraction and a safety risk. Even if you don't lose your life you could end somebody else's. Overall things it's just down right illegal. In my opinion cell phones should not be used while operating a vehicle in any capacity.",0
"To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted four-day work week, with each day consisted of ten hours. Like other places, the energy conservation in the school is also important. To have four-day school with additional two hours, is not a good idea due many problems.

Having four-day school is a good idea, because of some advantages. By having three days off from school student will have more time to do other things such as, they can spend more time on job, sports, picnics, other courses, etc. The students will have more time to relax and the students will be mentally well prepared for coming work days. Due to this, we can also conserve large amount of energy and other resources.

On the other hand, it also has a lot of disadvantages. By having two additional hours every day the student will be tired and they have to do more work every day. As a result, the students will not able to pay attention toward learning. When you are tired you can not able to pay full attention toward studies, due to which this is useless because students will not able to learning anything. This will also effect their grades. The students that do part time job they will face problem in doing that. The students who are willing to participate in extra curriculum activities, they will not able to participate in it. These are the reason that makes it a bad idea.

Four-day work week have more disadvantages. To make education and studies wealthy, we should not adopt it because it makes the studies and learning worthless. That is why having f our-day work week is a bad idea.                                    ",0
"I am agianst of useing technolgy to read to students cause when they do they just scan threw the stuff they never explain what happen how it happen and what was left of everything. and it also reads fast to you sometimes also. Then another reason is because if the kids got stuff read to them everytime how are they going to think how the book or article is about they need to read it on there own so they can understand whats going on every second threw the book or article they are reading id u let technology take over reading how are we going to learn make kids read the books and articles and they will have fun doing it.

This is were i got the evendince from to support my awnser were i got it from is pargraph three why. Because they had computers involed saying they made this thing called FACS (Facial Action Coding System) what is does is makes a human face takes it to the computer and put it on there like a real face and it put expresions and muslces in the face to make it very real looking. I think its neat but what are we learning here. Nothing cause no body really cares about it except computer geeks and gamers its a waste of our time we could be useing to do help full thing like saving people and feeding the homeless in this world, or getting a job or creating something better or full filling your dreams.

To sum this thing all up is. Lets make the kids read there own books and articles cause they will learn something new everyday, not bye letting technology read to them let them read so they can under stand and learn cool boring things so they can go home and tell mom,dad,grandma, and grandpa what they learned today. Take technology out of reading and put yourkids into it.",0

Summer break has long been a staple of the school year for students and is widely viewed as an important facet of traditional education. On the one hand, there are many benefits to having a summer break. For example, after spending a long school year focusing their energies on their studies, the break allows students to rest and recuperate, helping them to re-energize and avoid burnout. Furthermore, students can use the break to engage in activities which supplement their education, such as volunteering, attending summer camps, or taking classes that their school doesn't offer. On the other hand, some argue that the gap in learning that can occur over a summer break results in a 'brain drain' which can set back students' academic performance upon returning to school each year. Studies have shown, however, that the impact of the summer vacation on student achievement is modest and that, overall, the positive effects of having a break outweigh the negatives.",1
Nobody know how the face got on mars because we never been their. This face could of been their from the jump and ya'll said it was a human face i never seen a face of a human shaped like that a day in my life. You see how the earth changed dont you think ohther plantes form in other shapes like i said people we have no evidence that an alien shaped this face on mars. How we know NASA didnt do this? they can do every thing eles like having a little car drive around on mars and see whats all their and bring littel rocks back from mras. People we got to understand that they is just trying to get our MONEY out of us why you think strang things come out of no were and then they put it on the web. Thats why they make us think stuff is out their like this how you know they didnt just make something that can carve this face on mars an now they trying to say it was aliens that did this. You got to think outside the box people dont let these people trick you for your money because the more attention you give them the more money you give them so please people open your eyes.,0
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."" by Nick D'Alto he is talking about a new Facial Action Coding System. This coding system detects the emotions a person is feeling at the time. They rely on the muscles from your face to tell them what emotions you are feeling. Their are six basic emotions, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Classrooms and schools should not use this technology for multiple reasons.

Classrooms should not use this technology for more than one reason. First of all in classrooms all over the world there are teachers, and those teachers are just trying to give there students the education they need. So when there is a computer operated coding system in there telling you the emotions of all your students every ten minutes that might be a big distraction, ecspeacially for the students. Can you imagine a classroom full of first graders trying to get anything done when there is practically a robot in there classroom? Another reason why this technology should not be used is for the students sake; maybe they like to keep there emotions to themselves and not be told how they are feeling.

Finally the cost to install or buy one of these for every classroom would probably be threw the roof.

In conclusion, classrooms should just rely on the teachers to do there jobs and ask a kid what there emotions are if needed. Now maybe in the future this could be a good experiment to test out, but for now things are fine as is. Because technology has brought us so far, it is hard to completly go aganist but everything comes with time and im sure this will to.",0
"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in cities and suburbs around the world. This shift in thinking is based on several advantages that come with reducing the reliance on cars. By limiting car usage, cities can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative transportation options, and enhance quality of life for residents.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, cities can significantly lower these emissions and contribute to environmental sustainability. This is especially important in the face of global climate change and the need to reduce our carbon footprint.

Additionally, limiting car usage can greatly improve air quality. The passage mentions that smog and pollution levels in cities like Paris and Bogota have become a serious public health concern. By implementing car-free days or car-reduced policies, cities can decrease the amount of harmful emissions released into the air, leading to cleaner and healthier environments for residents. This not only benefits human health but also the health of the planet.

Furthermore, limiting car usage promotes the use of alternative transportation options. The passage set mentions the example of Vauban, a suburb in Germany, where car ownership is allowed but parking is limited to a few designated areas. As a result, a majority of residents do not own cars and rely on bicycles, public transportation, walking, or car-sharing services. This kind of shift helps to reduce traffic congestion, promote physical activity, and enhance overall accessibility for everyone, including those without access to cars.

An additional advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in quality of life for residents. The passage set discusses how residents of Vauban in Germany have reported feeling happier and less stressed since giving up car ownership. With fewer cars on the road, neighborhoods become quieter, streets become safer for pedestrians and cyclists, and communities become more vibrant and connected. This creates a more livable and people-friendly environment, where residents can enjoy walking or biking to nearby amenities and interacting with their neighbors.

In conclusion, limiting car usage in cities and suburbs has several advantages that should be considered by citizens and policymakers alike. It can lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative transportation options, and enhance quality of life for residents. As we face the challenges of climate change and strive for more sustainable and livable communities, limiting car usage is an important step in the right direction.",1

Success is often achieved through hard work, dedication, focus, and discipline, but failure is also an important part of the journey. Many successful scientists, students, entrepreneurs, and social media influencers have found a path to success through their experiences of failure. Thomas Edison famously said, “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” He was willing to take risks and learn from his mistakes to invent the light bulb. Similarly, student athletes learn that while failure can be devastating, it gives them the opportunity to become better players, teammates, and people. The same can be said of entrepreneurs who must try, fail, adjust, and try again, learning valuable lessons along the way. Social media is another avenue through which success is achieved. Many influencers have achieved success overnight, yet this will usually only last as long as the hype. Those who combine skill with persistence, failure, and determination are more likely to become successful in the long term. Learning from failure enables us to make smarter decisions and consider different plans of action, leading to greater success.",1
"Advice is wonderful and helpful to everyone. Since people often need this, when making choices. Seeking advice from many people is important so you can change your view from hearing others advice, and finding good advice for the decisions you make.

Hearing advice from more than one person is useful when a decision is present. This gives you a new view on your options. Also to find new ways to make better choices. For instance you can use a person's advice to change the way you see your choices. Then using that to decide.

When you need, to choose your best option. Good advice is amazing. Making a choice can become easier. This could also help you find a better way to pick your choice. For instance your having trouble with a decision. You could use all the great advice someone gave to you to decide.

Advice is important to our choices. People tend to need advice quite a lot. Therefore asking a much of people for advice is helpful for our viewing of decision making.",0
"I think students should come up with their own summer projects design because, students can come up with really creative projects, could have more fun doing their own design projects,and will have less stress over the summer.

Students can come up with really creative projects over summer by researching experiments, or about someones life. A student can look up science experiments to do as their projects that could be entrusting for the class or for them selves to. Also they can talk about a famous person or about someone in their family and explain why they wrote about that person. Students can invent new projects and show off to the class and explain how they came up with it and what will their invention help them or others.

Students could have more fun creating their own projects. Students will be more exited to be able to do create their own projects then follow a boring one a teacher assigned everyone. Students can come up with really creative work if you let them free roam. Students could in joy doing work that doesn't have to follow a checklist. Students could also can work on a project with their friends.

Lastly students can feel less stress about doing a project. Students will be able to work on a project without having to stress about it being perfect or if its following the checklist. Students can come up with their own checklist and show their classmates how they came up with it so the other students can do it one day for fun.

In conclusion, these our my reason why i think students should design their own summer projects.",0

Humans have a natural desire to ""fit in"" in society but often this can come at a price. One of the most common ways in which people attempt to fit in is by imitating others, especially those we admire and aspire to be like. While this can be seen as an advantage – allowing us to pick up positive qualities from role models who are already successful – it can also have drawbacks. For example, by trying to fit in and act a certain way, we can become afraid of making mistakes; we become so fixated with blending in that we can unwittingly compromise our own character and originality. 

At the same time, it is important to recognize that often our character is formed by several influences beyond our control. From the people we look up to, to our upbringing and environment, we are unavoidably shaped by outside forces. However, while we cannot control what external influences there are, we can decide how we react to them and determine the level to which they will shape our character.",1

But what you are accualy looking at is a mesa with weird shadows on it that make it look like a face. if you look at the picture from 1997 then at the picture from 2001 you can clearly see that their isnt a face.

"Phones and Driving

People can't continue to allow phones while driving. More laws should be enforced about having phones in your possession while operating a motor vehicle. It is very dangerous and can lead to fatal situations. However, others think it's not necessary to have laws that take away time on the phone while driving.

Throughout the last couple years, having phones while driving have been a big factor in car accidents. There have been laws that have been put out to try and keep people from using them while driving but people do not like to listen. This causes car crashes and human death.

Car crashes are the main causes of teen death alone. Most of them are from using phones while driving. Over 1.6 million crashes happen each year due to phone use. Nearly 390,000 injuries.

So from now on we have to limit or even take away because people's lives are at risk with these phones. Teens deaths are going to continue to rise. Death tolls will spike if we let this happen. Laws will have to enforce it more aggressively.",0
"Making a decision is difficult. Whether it's as big as buying a house, or as small as choosing an ice cream flavor, it's hard. Even if you know what you want, how do you decide? While some people give it no thought at all, others do a lot of research. But there isn't really a right or wrong way of doing it. At the end of the day, you'll eventually come to a decision no matter how you got there. But there is one way that people find very helpful when making a difficult choice. Asking others for their opinion. Some people might disagree, but this method is actually very helpful. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, because it helps them become more open-minded and give them more options. While there are several other methods, this one has a couple of benefits.

When you make a decision, sometimes you'll just go with your gut. Let's say you're in line ordering ice cream. There are so many flavors to choose from, but your gut tells you to just go with vanilla. Because it's the one flavor you have tried, you order vanilla. For some of us, this is the case. We go with our gut, because who knows yourself better than you? It's okay to trust yourself, but sometimes you start to become closed-minded. This situation can completely change if you just ask a friend for their advice. Instead of ordering vanilla, you might get cookies and cream or rocky road. By hearing these other opinions, you become more open-minded. This will help you with decision making and other situations in life. The reason why seeking multiple opinions is helpful with decision making is, because it helps you become more open-minded.

Usually when you have to make a choice, the few options make it hard to come to a decision. But asking people for their opinion make it easier to come to make a choice. It might not make sense that asking people for their opinion will magically create more options to choose from. That's not what it does exactly, but it does give you more ""combinations"". Let's say you were debating whether you should get a dog or not. You couldn't decide, so you go to your friends for advice. One of them says that you should get a dog, because they're very loyal. Another says you should get a dog, because they will keep you active. Another one says you should not get a dog, because they're a lot to maintain. Now you have different ""combinations"". Two responses have the same answers but a different reason. This method helps you list the pros and cons for both choices so that you can make the best decision. Seeking multiple opinions is helpful when making a decision, because it gives you more options.

To some people, trusting their gut is the best way to make a decision. To others, it's listing the pros and cons. But if you really think about it, asking people for advice is probably the best choice. The reason why it's the best choice is, because you will be more open-minded and have more options when making a decision. Sometimes someone else's opinion, whether you agree with it or not, helps you see more clearly. Life is full of decisions, and eventually, you won't know what choice is better. Just ask a friend, review your options, and make a decision. Maybe you will regret your decision, but everything will work out in the end.",0
"Cars, they are a part of alot of peoples everyday life. They alow you to get around easly whenever you need to, but what would you do without them. Some communitys are giving up cars like in ""[Vauban] Germany [where]...[s]treet parking, driveways and home garages are generaly forbiden"" (source 1). This may sound crazy but ""57 percent [of Vauban's families] sold a car to move [there]"" and ""70 percent [] do not own cars' (source 1). One of the reson pepole do this is to reduce there emisions to help the enviroment.

Emisions can ahave a drastic effect on citys because, many people driving in a small area can lock the gases in the city causing smog. In Paris ""[a]fter days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air ... On Monday motorist with even-numbered licence plates were ordered to leave their cars at home... the same would apply to the odds the next day"" (source2). In places like this people don't like having days where they can't use there car, as shown by the ""4,000 drivers [that] were fined"" (source 2) But, in other places people like having a day without their car.

Places like Bagota, Colombia ""cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permited for the Day Without Cars"" (source 3), where people enthuaicticly use alternitive transportation to get to work. For some people not driving relives stress, a bussnes man living in Bagota says ""[the day without cars is] a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" (source 3).

Even though cars may seem like an important part of out society today, a cultural shift may be leading america away from cars. ""The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter"" (source 4) so even though you may depend on youer car every day in a couple of years cars may not be the main transportation for the US. So you may want to start thinking about using other forms of transport because the age of the poluting cars is coming to an end.",0
"As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide a balanced argument on the topic of whether computer games have produced more negative effects than positive ones on children's development.

On the one hand, some people argue that computer games have negative effects on children's physical, intellectual, and psychological development. Firstly, playing computer games for extended periods can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can cause obesity, poor posture, and other health problems. Secondly, some computer games may contain violent or inappropriate content, which can desensitize children to violence and negatively impact their behavior and attitudes. Thirdly, excessive gaming can lead to addiction, which can affect children's academic performance, social skills, and mental health.

On the other hand, others argue that computer games have positive effects on children's development. Firstly, computer games can improve children's cognitive skills, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and spatial awareness. Secondly, some computer games can enhance children's creativity and imagination, as they allow them to explore new worlds and express themselves in different ways. Thirdly, computer games can provide social benefits, as they allow children to connect with other players and develop teamwork and communication skills.

In my opinion, the effects of computer games on children's development depend on various factors, such as the type of game, the amount of time spent playing, and the child's individual characteristics and circumstances. Therefore, rather than preventing children from playing computer games altogether, it is essential to educate them about the potential risks and benefits and encourage them to play in moderation and with parental supervision.

In conclusion, while computer games can have both positive and negative effects on children's development, it is crucial to approach the topic with an open mind and consider the individual needs and circumstances of each child. By doing so, we can ensure that children can enjoy the benefits of computer games while minimizing the potential risks.

"Seeking advice from multiple people when facing an important decision can provide significant benefits. By getting different perspectives on a situation, you gain a more well-rounded understanding of your options and their pros and cons. No single person has a monopoly on good advice, and different people will approach problems from unique angles. 

Each person you consult brings their own life experiences, wisdom, values and frame of reference. What seems like an obvious choice to one may not be so clear cut when viewed through another lens. Discussing a dilemma with friends, family members, colleagues, mentors or experts in relevant fields exposes you to diverse viewpoints you may not have considered on your own. This helps ensure you don't miss important factors or make assumptions without realizing. 

Relatedly, multiple viewpoints reduces the risk of being unduly swayed by a biased or inaccurate opinion. If different people draw similar conclusions after hearing all sides, their collective judgment is likely to be sound. But if viewpoints are mixed, it suggests complexities you need to carefully weigh yourself. Discussing trade-offs with others also pushes you to think through choices in a more methodical way, clarifying your own priorities in the process. 

Finally, gaining confidence in a decision through cross-validation can empower better follow-through. By understanding how multiple trusted individuals analyzed a problem, you feel more invested in and committed to the eventual solution. This commitment strengthens your resolve to implement the choice fully and reduce second guessing later on. Overall, considering the expertise and experiences of various sources helps people make carefully deliberated choices they feel at peace with over the long run.",1
"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become mandatory in most of our lives. Smartphones are a class of mobile phones and of multi-purpose mobile computing devices. They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones Were founded in 1992. Since smartphones were created every year they get more modern. For example june 7, 2010 facetime was created. The smartphone is changing the human race in surprising ways.

Driving and using your cell phone at the same time is very dangerous. Most people think that they can drive so being on their phone while driving wont hurt anybody or anything, but anybody who agrees with this is wrong and is in danger every time he/ she pulls out a phone while the car is in drive. Also, if you use your cellular device and drive at the same time you always have someone else's life at stake. Even if you're in the car by yourself you can hurt someone else, imagine you have your head down in your phone while driving and you look up and you about to hit a car and swerve to the right and hit a whole family walking on the sidewalk. Then your in a bad situation just because you couldn't wait till you get home to text or look at your instagram feed. One little bad time to look at your phone and your hurting a family.

I believe that you shouldn't be allowed to use your phone while your car is in drive. In georgia they made a new law that you can't have your phone in your hand while on the road,not even to tap play and if you get caught the law enforcement will pull you over and give you a $50 fine. I believe it should be like this in every state , it the makes the community a lot safer. Did you know 11 teens die every day as a result of texting while driving. As of January 2019, three states -- Arizona, Montana, and Missouri -- insanely do not have laws against texting while driving.

According to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers knows the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway. 21% of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were distracted by their cell phones. The 2017 study published by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety Found that 87% of drivers view texting and driving as the most significant hazard on the road. In fact, drivers are more concerned about texting / distracted driving than they are about drunk driving. A single text can end many lives.

In conclusion, using your cellular device while driving is dangerous on all cases. Texting while driving causes 5 times as many accidents than drunk driving. A single text results in an average distraction of 5 seconds, during which time a car going 55 mph will travel the length of a football field. The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year. I Think you can wait to answer that text.",0
"Have you ever been in need of advice, but you just could not settle on one friend or family member to ask? I have found that when asking for advice it is most beneficial if you were to ask more than one person. When seeking advice it is best to find multiple inputs into your problem, because one person may not have the best advice for your situation, multiple inputs gives the person more options, and you can combine multiple advises, to fit into your specific problem.

One person may not have the best advice for your situation. Sometimes even though your close to somebody, they may not give the best advice. I love my grandparents, but I'm not nesscesarily going to go to them every time I have a big problem, just because your close with someone does not mean they can give you the very best advice. Good advice is not something that everyone can give. So it is important to ask more than one person, to compare and see which advice is the best for your situation. Some people just don't think like you do. Because of this some may give horrible suggestions to you and some may give life changing inputs. In conclusion, close friends and family don't always give the best advice, good advice is not something everyone can give, and not everyone can put themselves in your shoes.

Multiple suggestions give you more options. Multiple suggestions gives you the ability to mix and match the responses of friends and family. Say that someone is bullying you at school, and you don't what to talk to anyone at school about it, you can combine what your parents say and handle the situation. The more people that you ask, the more likely you are to find a response that you agree with. If you were to ask what shoe to buy, by the time you have finished, you'll have found plenty of shoes that you like. Finally, multiple responses to a question free's up the possibility to out-rule the suggestions you did not like, and roll with ones you do like. When you take in only a couple of responses, you may not get the advice you need. In conclusion, with multiple advises given you can not only mix and match responses from your peers, but also combine responses, plus it gives you a more likely chance to find advice that you like, and finally, you can pick and choose which advice is helpful and which is not.

When getting responses it's best to limit the amount of advice given. You should limit the advice given because the advice given should be from a couple people you know very well. These responses are coming from people you trust and know very well, not just the average acquaintance. You can't trust just anyone with advice. If I wanted to know what it takes to play basketball in college, I'm not gonna ask just anyone, but people who I trust to give me a great answer

When seeking advice it is best to find multiple inputs into your situation, one person may not have the best advice for you and your situation, and the advice that you need is from people that know you the best. One person isn't always enough to give you the best answer, multiple suggestions are always needed and not everyone can give you advice. Advice is something everyone needs, and is best when it comes from the many people that love you.",0
"Dear, State Senator

I think we should keep the Electoral College. Even though it is despised method of choosing our nation leader, it is the best form of desiding who will run and the winner. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding father established it in the Constitution as a compromise between elections ot the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting for the electors wherer they vote for the President and the Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

I think that we should keep the Electoral College for five reasons. Number one,

Certainty of Outcome . Which is a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. Number two,

Everyone's president . Which is the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. Number three,

Swing States . The Swing States is a winner-takes-all method of awarding electoral votes incluces the canidates. Number four,

Big States . The Big States is the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the politcal balance that the large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. Last but not least is number five,

Avoid Run-Off Elections . Avoiding Run-Off Elections is when the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Elecoral College is not all that fair though because it is an anachronism, a non-democtratic method of selecting a president the ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.

I think we should keep the Electoral College. Even though it is despised method of choosing our nation leader, it is the best form of desiding who will run and the winner. But it is the way our founding fathers made this nation and wanted it to stay that way because they created it that way.

"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I'll be using details from the article to form an eassay arguing whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom is valuable. I'll be sure to include, a claim for or against the value of using ths technology to read student' emotional expressions, evidence from the article to support the claim, and an introductions, a body, and a conclusion to my essay. The reasons i'm going to use are why it's valuable, how we can use it to help other, and how to use it correctly.

First of all let me explain the passge, the passage talks about how we can use technology to identify human emotions. How is this technology valuable, well it's very valuable. The FACS (Facial Actions Coding System) which is the technology that identify humans emotions, can let us see how everyone is. We can use the FACS everywhere that will help us to help people. Help everyone, and even animals. Help everyone in there time of need. Help those whom don't want help. Those who can't control themselves. Those that can't think correctly. Those whom are at the blink of death. A lot of people and so many more lives can be save with this technology.

How can we use it to help others? We can use the FACS to identify human emotions and help the ones that are sad. We can help them before somethings happens, like we can prevent a school shooting if we know how the persons feels. We can give them all the help they need. No lives have to be lost if we know how everyone feels. We can even stop people from killing themselves, we can change lives with this technology. We can even help those who don't want help because they are people to that are hurting. We have to help those in need and I know we can do it with the help of the FACS and change the world. It would be a lot safe out there. We can do all of this because of FACS and that's why i think its very valuable.

But there always a correct time to use this. If we can tell if someone is really depress that's when we do something because it's hard to control yourself when you are really sad. We shouldn't just wait and see what happens, we have to do something about it, because we are all human. If we see someone very depress we try to cheel them up, but what if we can't tell. That's also another example when we should use them. We can stop things from happening, bad things.

Futhermore I believe that the use of this technology can be very useful in many ways. In my essay i have show you why it's valuable, how we can use it to help other, and how to use it correctly. I also include a claim for or against the value of using ths technology to read student' emotional expressions, evidence from the article to support the claim, and an introductions, a body, and a conclusion to my essay. This technology called the FACS (Facial Actions Coding System) which is the technology that identify humans emotions, can help many people in there life, make it easliy for us to help those people, can help save people lives from hurting themselves or others, and make us prevent school shooting, people killing themselves, and save people life in many ways.",0
"Since new software is coming out, people are coming up with ideas on trying to see if people are hiding their emotions. The Mona Lisa is a great example on emotions, people want to know if she is smiling, frowning, or they want to know how she's feeling.

The new software wants to calculate other people's emotions. People are beginning to make 3-D computer models of faces to see all of our muscles and to see how they move like a human does. As studies say we all have six normal emotions, we have happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and by showing that our facial movements change and move to show our emotion. An example on how we show our emotions are that if we raise our eyebrow to show that we are suprised on what another person has said or done, and another one is when people tighten their jaw and lip that shows that they're angry. The Mona Lisa is another great example because we don't know how she is feeling, we don't know if she is feeling sad, happy, depressed, or many more things.

When you look in the mirror how do you look? People might see the stress on their face because lack of sleep, some others might see sadness because of a break up, and their are many other examples on this topic. Mirrors can't detect if we're sad, happy, scared, and more things becasue it's not a computer, we can detect if we're feeling a certain type of way. We should look at how our face looks when we look, we should look at how different our face changes when we go from happy to sad.

When making a face it might make you feel happy or sad. The experiment and technology shows how people really feel. When people say, ""put a smile on that face"", it might make you smile or chuckle a little bit. Drama coachs or acting coaches might ant their actors or actrecess work on their facial expressions. When someone acts you can sometimes feel how they're feeling, and so if they aren't aren't doing a good job at acting then you wouldn't know hot to feel. People will see how your emotions are and will feel a certain way because of how your expressions are or how your posture is.

Making facial expressions shows a lot on how someone is feeling. Experiments can show many different things.",0
"Limiting car usage will be very important in the near future and can be very deadly for the enviroment if not we do not conserve and reduce car use. Using a car is expensive for everybody because think of if you get into an accident and it was your fault you have to then pay for your car and the opposing persons car. It can also be a health hazar where if you live in a big city with lots of running cars then it can be dangerous to be breathing in all those chemicals and you might end up getting a diseas or condition like maybe cancer of the lungs or bronchitis.

To begin with, the expenses of a car can be very high and very low, depending on where you stand on it. but if you ever get into an accident and its your fault and you have to payoff the other person and also pay for your car to be fix (if it hasnt been totaled). Payment of cars can kill you though maybe you wont have enough to pay your electricity bill for your apartment or you cant pay for an oil change so your car is useless now and you are still paying to have it look pretty even though you cant even pay for the oil to be changed.

To continue, think that you`re living in a big city like new york or chicago or philidelphia. Now think of every single car in that city. Alot right? well every single one of those cars do the same thing they just are used to get to point A to point B. well think of all the gas that car is pooring into the streets by just sitting at a red light. now can you see about another couple hundred thousand doing that at the same time? its pretty bad right? all that gas and chemicals hits the streets first then you can smell it from your 4th story apartment and then its stuck in there for hours. think about how bad that is for your lungs and all your senses. Im no doctor but id say that its pretty horrible and maybe even cancerous. just think about that before you dont limit usage on your car!

For a conclusion, id like you to remember that cars are not just transportation but also chemical exhausters that have the effect to kill any man or women of any age. So maybe just maybe if you limited car usage you might be saving a life and also not spending to much money on your car and more on bills to be saving your own life cause water and electricity bills are some of the most expensive bills out there.

Liting car usage is important and we all need to be like the town of Vauban in germany.",0
"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill stated a quote that said, ""success consists of going from failure to failure with out loss."" There are 3 reasons why I agree with this statement. The first reason is, failing will want to make you push for a success, the second reason being that you'll have more of enthusiasm when you're find more ways to succesed, and the third reason is achiving for higher goals.

I agree strongly with this prompt and Winston Chruchill's quote, yet some people think it's something at may not be true and think less of them self. In the first paragraph I will explain my first reasoning with a strong example of it.

First, reasoning to this prompt would be, falling will want to make you push for success. Even though not many people think that is the way that many of our past inventors had learned. Albert Enstine was one of the smartest people out there, yet he had come face to face with failure many times in his life. The only way he learned was to try many other different ways to solve his problems. He used failure as an insperation to to keep trying like our first inventor of the light blub. Even though many people found it frusterated and diffivult when they've failed, which pushes on to my second reasoning.

Next, the reason would be that many people think different about them selfs when they fail in something. Thomas Edison thought different, even though he had failed 100 times, he had not gave up. When he finally successed, he said a quote that is in my mind till today in this presnet day. That quote was ""I didn't fail 100 times, I found 100 ways that it didn't work."" Even though, Thomas Edison had failed he maintaned him self with a lot of enthusiasm, Failure is never an option, but finding a solution to it is a success.

Finally, the last and final reason is achiving for high goals that you want to reach. It don't matter what others may think of it or if you'll be able to achive or not. Show them that they are wrong even if you come to a failure don't stop, find a solution and fix it to make it better than before. You'll reach higher goals with higher potential then what you'll ever imagine. Then later on you will be able to do anything you put your mind to and demonstrate your knowlage to the world.

In conclusion, doubting yourself is not how you achive your success. Finding a way to solve it is achive your success. Get the insperation from the people who had once been in your spot and they done to successed to there goal. Even if failure is a role in life to find success it's the only way youll reach it. Failure is only a motivation to get you to successed.",0
"Dear Florida Senator,

I believe that we should not have the Electoral College no more. We are giving people false hopes that there vote counts when it really does not. We see on TV ads that we should vote and let our voices be heard but when in reality it is not. Didn't Lincoln once say ""A nation founded by the people for the people by the people...""  he was saying that we should let people have a a voice in everything that happens in America, but we can not even have a voice in who we wanted as president.

We give all the power to the Electoral College but not to the people. In 2000 Al Gore won the popular votes but lost the presidency. What type of system is this where we vote for who we want  but get who we do not want. What the whole reason to vote if the Electoral College vote is more important then our. Beside voting for the president we want we vote for the slate of electors who elect the president. We don't even know who these mysterious Electoral College are they can vote for a president just because he is in the Democratic Party,we have no ideas why.

In 2000 we had the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse when it came to Electoral College. ""Consider that state legislatures was technically responsible for the picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency. The people vote was not heard in that year,because they wanted Al Gore respresenting by the Democratic Party but we got Geroge W. Bush. I have never heard of a more unfair voting system before. Where were our rights the freedom of speech then, it was no where to be found. I feel that voting for who never we want should be in the Bill of Rights. So it okay to a gun for safety in our bag but itnot okay to vote for what we want.

On most basic level, the Electoral College is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all-system in each state. Some candidates do not spend that much time in states they know they have no chance of winning. In 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not get to see Geroge Bush or Al Gore these states were Rhodes Island with 3 electoral votes and South Carolina with 9 electoral votes. Candidates mostly only visit the states with the most like Florida with 29 and Texas with 38. They do not care about the other states they only care about who have the most electoral votes.

Each party selects slate of electoral they trust to vote for the party nominee and they have rarely been betrayed. It is could be true that the winner of electoral  vote will not win base off of the national popular vote. But it is most likely not to happen again like in 2000 when Al Gore had more popular votes then Bush. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. So no Electoral can have a solid favorite they must vote on who would most likely chance America for the better.

But if the Al Gore vs. Bush happen once what stop it for happening again the reason why it happen was because we had Electoral College so to stop it. We Must stop it.

Florida state Senator as much of a good idea it is to have at some point in time it will go wrong. All good things, have bad endings. So I think it better to stop it now before things for the wrongs like Americans just stop voting becasue we all know our votes do not mean a thing when it come to Electoral College votes.",0
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", explains how technology created by Prof. Thomas Huang and his colliague Prof. Nicu Sebe have been devolping better ways for humans and coputer to communicate. Almost all people can read someone's emotion through the expression they give even through a fake smile, and some over look this. Say it's chritmas and your parents get you a bag of grape fruits, you probably are going to be unsatisfied or annoyed, angry even. If it was from your parents though your going to put on a show and smile and and probably say things like ""wow, this is awesome"". Faking an expression like this will most definently fool your parents, but with this new technology you would simply be able to know how you child is feeling.

The question is though whether or not the use of this technology would be useful in students classrooms be valuanle. To some teachers it might affect them to the fact students keep falling asleep or not doing homework, and maybe just maybe with this technology you would be able to change your teaching style to create a more fun, interesting time in class. Honestly though It doesn't need to be used in classes. Why would you need to use it in the classroom. People have different emotions everyday, heck every second. Why would you need a device that reads emothions for school. This technology would be much better used in a game or a useful tool for phsycologist. There is no reason for it. If you had it would you use it to change the way a student is feeling probably not. Just cause there is technology that can determine somene's emotion doesn't mean it can change the way that person is feeling. Sometimes people need to fake the truth anyways.",0
"The electoral college should be eliminated. It should be changed to popular vote for the presidential election. With the electoral college, people don't get to have the freedom to vote for who they want to be elected. Instead they vote for a slate of electors who in turn, elect the president for you. There are a few problems with this. One, the electors could end up not doing their job. They might refuse to vote for their party's candidate and end up voting for whomever they please. That could turn into a riot or just leave a lot of people very unhappy. The electors could also mess up their vote and end up voting for the wrong candidate. Say they are loyal to the president they are suppose to vote for, but then end up choking and voting for the opposing president. Further more, what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. (""What's wrong with the electoral college"") Another thing is a tie could happen. A tie in the electoral vote means that the election then gets handed to the House of Reprsentatives, where they will then vote on the president of their choice. Either way the people do not get a say on who they want for president. It is all in the hands of people that can turn their backs on who they promise they will vote for, and end up voting for the opposing president. If the people got to choose who they wanted to be president, then we wouldn't run into any of these problems. There would never be any ties or broken promises. The electoral college is ""unfair, outdated, and irrational."" The electoral college should be abolished.",0
"Nowadays, electronic dictionaries (E-dictionaries) have been increasingly popular among students. However, there is a growing concern among teachers that the overuse of E-dictionaries might have more disadvantages than advantages for English learning. This is because, while E-dictionaries are very convenient and useful tools, they can also lead to the deterioration of our spelling ability.

There are several reasons why reliance on E-dictionaries may have a negative effect on our spelling skills. Firstly, because E-dictionaries are so easy to use, students may be tempted to use them for every word they encounter, instead of trying to spell the word correctly from memory. Secondly, the definitions and examples provided by E-dictionaries can often lead to confusion and incorrect spellings. Finally, the use of E-dictionaries can also encourage students to use shortcuts and informal spellings, which can be difficult to unlearn.

All of these factors suggest that teachers should discourage the overuse of E-dictionaries, and instead encourage their students to rely on their own memory and common sense when it comes to spelling. This is not to say that E-dictionaries should never be used – they can be very helpful tools – but they should not be used to the exclusion of other methods of learning spellings. In conclusion, while E-dictionaries are a valuable resource, they should be used with caution, and should not be relied on to the detriment of other learning methods.

"Venus is the closest planet to Earth. The planet Venus is known as Earth's twin because its the close to earth density and size, and is also sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" The author claims that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The aurthour says in paragraph 4 that Venus can be our nearest option for a planetary vist. The author also says that Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have many forms of like, like Earth. The author also says in paragraph 8 that our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

I think that we should not waste our time to explore Venus. Even though the planet is somewhat identical to Earth, the planet is very chaotic and dangerous. In paragraph 3, the author tells the readers the many dangers of Venus. The planet is covered in a thick atmosphere of about 97 carbon dioxide, and the atmosphere has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Also, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what Earth is. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature in our solar system, considering that Mercury is the closet planet to the sun. The weather on Venus also has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes. Yes we can look and take samples, but the spacecraft we sent to Venus has not survived the landing for more than a couple of hours. We could vist Venus, but it could be nearly impossible with Venus conditions.

Venus, Earth's ""twin,"" is similar to Earth in size and density. But the clouds and temperatures make it nearly impossible to live on Venus. We sent many spacecraft to Venus, but none could survive for a couple of hours. The conditions of the planet is chaotic, and the atmosphere is as toxic as it could get. Astronomers think that Venus was probably covered with oceans and had life on the planet. Venus today, has a rocky surface, which includes valleys, mountains, and craters. We should study the chaotic planet, but living conditions are nearly impossible.",0
"As we all know, cars have become an essential part of our daily lives. We use them to commute to work, school, and for our daily errands. However, excessive car usage has several negative impacts on our environment and health. Therefore, it is crucial to limit car usage to enjoy the following advantages.

Firstly, reducing car usage can significantly reduce air pollution. According to the passage, cars emit harmful gases that pollute the air we breathe, causing respiratory problems and other health issues. By limiting car usage, we can reduce the number of cars on the road, which means fewer emissions, and cleaner air for everyone.

Secondly, limiting car usage can lead to reduced traffic congestion. As more people use cars, the number of vehicles on the road increases, leading to traffic jams and longer travel times. This not only wastes our time but also contributes to increased fuel consumption and air pollution. By limiting car usage, we can reduce the number of cars on the road, leading to less traffic congestion and a smoother flow of traffic.

Lastly, limiting car usage can encourage people to adopt healthier lifestyles. Walking or cycling to work or school is an excellent way to stay active and healthy. By reducing car usage, we can encourage people to adopt these healthier modes of transportation, leading to a healthier population and reduced healthcare costs.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages, including reduced air pollution, less traffic congestion, and healthier lifestyles. Therefore, we should all strive to reduce our car usage by carpooling, using public transportation, walking, or cycling whenever possible. By doing so, we can contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment for ourselves and future generations.",1
"I know taking online or watching video conferencing class can be relaxing sometime, and sometimes student even pray for school to be close. but that does not mean student should take online classes or watch video conferencing , It not a good idea for student to be take online classes and I am not in favor of the idea for student to take online or watch video conferencing because they can find the online teaching to be boring and it will be very hard for student to understand the teaching of the video.

Although some people might think that taking online or video conferencing class can be helpful because student can get a lot of sleep before starting the class and the student will be the one to choose the time he or she wish to take the class or watch the video conferencing.

firstly why I don't agree with the idea of taking home school or watch video conferencing is because student find home school to be boring and they can't focus in the teaching of the video conferencing. like for example if the person who is teaching in the video speaks softly it will make that student feel sleeping and by the time he or she get up the video might be finish at the end of the day the student don't gained anything from the online teaching, and other student will turn on the video and still be charting with their friends on the phone while the video is playing, he or she will not focus on the video that is teaching.

secondly why I said home schooling or video conferencing can't be beneficial for student is because student will find it very hard to understand the teaching of the video conferencing or the home schooling. like if the video is playing but the student don't understand the teaching of the video he or she can't get the chance to ask question about what they don't understand .And some of this video teaching sometime is really confusing the student that why other student prefer to set in class while teaching so that if he or she don't understand they can ask question about the topic. other student have their young ones at home while he or she want to listen to the teaching their young ones will be make noise so they can't get what the video is teaching about and that will make them not to understand the teaching.

I am not in favor of the idea of student taking online classes because they will find it very boring which they can't focus on the teaching and it will very hard for them to understand the teaching of the video.

for this way I find it very difficult for student to gained any learning from taking the online or the video conferencing class.       ",0
"The new technology called Facial Action Coding System enables computures to identify human emotions. The process begins when the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face. The fourty-four muscles in the model must move like human muscels. Dr. Paul Eckman creator for FACS calculated the emotions of Mona Lisa. I do not believe that FACS is important for the students to learn about.

This technology is not important to what is going on to in the class room or in todays world. The students in highschool have other things they have to be getting ready for like graduation. There are standards into graduating on time or even early and I am sure learning how to caluclate emotions from a computer and pictures is not one of them. The technology is in the path of achievment if the activity is in a progam by its self and not in the high school or middle school. Some students are pushing the edge to gradutate as it is. This will be something they will want to do and they cant if they are behind in their classes. These students already have way more technology on their hands now adays than they should. The technology is upgrading each day. FACS is not something that would help someones career with in the futrue. School's should be about helping kids get ready for the future. They should not make everything the students be on the computers. Some people want to contain the knowledgement about the expresstions on other peoles faces than gradution than they should take a class about FACS out side of school. The kid in elementry are not going to know what paper and pencil's even are if we keep coming up this technologys like this that we dont really need. I would not want a computer telling people, or evem myself, what mood i am in. I know what mood I am in. I would not want my parents to know if I was mad because I would be mad at them and not want them to know. If people wanted you to know their feelings they will most likely tell you how they feel. The Facial Action Coding System is the waste of a schools money. The money that is put into the FACS is way more than a school could possibly They could use the money to fix something around the school. The FACS is just way out of hand.

"I say that the ""Face"" on Mars is just a natural landform because first of all aliens do not live, and second of all why would an alien create a human face.

I think that is an alien created this human ""face,"" the alienwould have created a face of an alien because probably aliens have never seen a human before.

I do believe that at first you would probably think that an alien created this but after many scientists researching and exploring the ""face"" they clearly stated ""this face reminds us most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plan of Idaho.""

Just like Earth is a plant Mars is also a planet,, and just like Earth has natural landformation many other plants have natural landformation not just Earth.

In the articule it states ""the rock formation even has eyes, nose, and a mouth,"" I personaly do not think that an alien could create something with such details.

Not just in Mars, scientists and explorers have found many natural landformation.

After all that Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter studied they finally found out that the ""face"" was just a natural landformation.

All the scientists and people who believed it was an alien still wanted to research more beacuse they didn't believe that it was a landformation, this is based on what I have heard.

Again what this image acutually shows is the Martian of a butte or mesa landforms common around the Ameriacan West.

In the article it also states that the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as thye Face on Mars.""",0
"You've been accepted to two ivy-league universities, but you can only go to one. You're torn between the two and don't know what to pick. Your intuition says to go to the first one because it has a better program, but it's also nearly twice the cost of the second one. Which do you choose? This problem is common for many in our country. While it may not be about picking a school, we constantly comes across two choices, but can only choose one. Many of these choices do not matter, but during important times, they must be deeply thought about. All benefits and downsides have to be taken into consideration, but these factors don't need to be tackled alone. One can always use advice from your parents or mentors because asking it will always make an action easier. When making a decision, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

To start off, looking for multiple opinions will make one more knowledgeable about their options. For example, the Micheal Scott Institute of Human Services, an American group aimed at providing mental health information, states that when a person has at least two opinions on a decision, 88% of people make a choice that isn't regretted. In other words, when someone gains more information on something, they're bound to make a good choice. With most students having access to a mentor, they can be taught to make smart decisions for themselves, something that not every person has the knowledge to do. This will impact their lifestyle as an adult and make them conscious about their choices, knowing that if they need a second opinion, they have one. Adults often feel like they can only trust themselves with decisions, but it can't hurt for someone to give you their opinion. In addition, according to an interview with high school student Marie Dongle on NBCNews, the largest news station in the United States, she became pregnant during her junior year. Marie was intelligent and had a big future ahead of her, but this was a major setback for her acting career. As a result, she got many opinions from her mentors and parents who were all in her best interest. Therefore, she decided to abort it. Marie says, ""It was the best decision I've ever made, and it was all because of the amazing community that helped me."" She now has her own talk show aimed at helping girls in similar situations. To rephrase, after asking other people about what she should do with her baby, Dongle aborted it so she could have the future she wanted. Taking care of a baby is a difficult and exhausting job to do in your teen years, and Marie knew that she first had to learn how to take care of herself. This wouldn't have happened if it weren't for her supporting community around her. Gaining knowledge about a choice before you make it is crucial to becoming a rational decision maker and making smart choices.

Furthermore, trying to make a decision alone can cause physical and mental harm. In fact, the FDA, the national food and drug administration, says that when many teens are excruciatingly stressed, they can turn to brain suppresents to keep their mind off of it. Brain suppresents include items such as vapes, juuls, cigarettes, or alcohol. When a student makes a decision alone, they become increasingly stressed, which can possibly cause them to make unsafe decisions and unknowingly harm themselves as a way to get away from it. Teens shouldn't have the burden of having extreme amounts of stress because they're still young and learning the ways of our ever-changing world. The reason these teens form habits like these can only be because of our corrupt system of mental health in both schools and our country. Enough measures are not taken to ensure that actions like these are not to happen, and who's fault is that? It's certainly not that of the student in need. Famous philanthropist Oprah Gates says, ""It's not the fault of a child for hurting themselves, it's the adults. They fail to provide a safe world for their kids."" Adding onto the previous statement, the CDC, the US national health organization, states that 65% of people who decide to make their own decisions, typically introverted teens, results in high cortisol levels or chronic depression. High cortisol levels are released when one is stressed and can cause osteoporosis. To clarify, going solo when making choices can cause long-term depression and other illnesses. This type of problem is very small and easily avoidable by simply asking for advice and can make a large difference in our physical and mental health.

Finally, asking for help when making a decision to make a better choice can cause better mental health. Surprisingly, OOPS, an organization aimed at informing people about health improvements, reports that nearly 99%

of students that received help from social workers while making a decision about what classes to take increased dopamine levels in their brain, which caused them to not only feel less stressed, but more happier and confident. That may seem far-out, but it's true! By simply knowing that someone can guide you to a right path can improve your mental health. In our modern world, many factors such as bullying or poor self image can cause a student to feel depressed or alone, but by making strong decisions, it can rejuvenate their spirits and cause them to work and thrive. If 99% of students resulted in stronger mental health and less stress, then one can practically say that getting help to make decisions can result in both a good choice and a better person.

In the final analysis, it's clear that asking for opinions while making a decision can truly help someone pick a better choice. It educates them about their choices, increases self esteem, and could cause physical and mental harm if not done. It's important to have your opinions be heard about this topic because it's important to many people across the nation. If we never seek multiple opinions to aid our decisions, what type of reckless world would we live in?",0
"Dear Florida Senator, The ongoing debate of whether or not the Electoral College process is fair or unjust is always around you, I presume. I would like to give some personal feedback in the matters of this situation.

I understand that the Electoral College was created in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Source 1 However it is not a fair or even equal compromise. The people hardly have any political voice in this aspect. The electors that in return vote for the people generally aren't chosen by the people, the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. Some state laws vary Source 1 If you faithfully are going to vote for the Presidential candidate of your choice, you should be able to have faith in your vote. Those in favor of the Electoral College could make the remark that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...""Source 3 In the world of reality people don't just want make a comment and expect no reaction, people want to be heard. This is similar to voting, people want their vote to count toward the candidate of their choice not the electors for the candidate.

This then runs into the problem of unfaithful electors. Their votes are never for sure. Although they claim to have ""trust that is rarely betrayed"" Source 3 you can never be a hundred percent sure in the electors. ""Faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" Source 2 If this happens the popular vote actually wouldn't go to the thought candidate.

""Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" Source 2 In a case of a tie the vote would go to the House of Representatives. This means that each state would only be able to cast one vote. This is not a smart backup plan. It is not fair for states of different population sizes to have one vote basically being categorized as one. Proportionally it is not right for a state who represents 500,000 such as Wyoming to recieve the same number of equally weighted votes as a state who represents 35 million such as California. Source 2 The Electoral College also follows the ""Winnertakeall"" method. This means that most in most elections the focus is on the swing states or toss up states, all the efforts go to these states. Even though ""the voters are most likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"", as said by those who believe in the Electoral College Source 3 what about the voters who have been faithful all along? How can you expect them to feel when they barely get noticed? Those are the ones the candidates should be thanking and having gratitute toward because they are the ones who will be supporting them and their campaign.

I know that politics are filled with misconceptions and many confusing roles and aspects but please consider my thoughts and words. I speak for the voiceless and my fellow neighbors, but most importantly I speak for what our government was founded upon, WE THE PEOPLE.",0
"I agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. One reason is that a lot of the time, the images that are used in advertisements are edited in a way that makes the product look better than it really is. For example, if a product is supposed to be shiny and new, advertisements may use a photo that makes it look like the product is new and shiny. However, if you actually buy the product and take it home, you may find that it is not as new or shiny as the advertisement made it look. This is because advertisements use edited photos that make the product look better than it is in reality.

Another reason that advertisements make products seem better than they are is because a lot of the time, the actual product is not as good as the advertisement makes it'seem. For example, if an advertisement says that a product is going to give you long, beautiful hair, you might be disappointed when you buy the product and find that it does not work as well as the advertisement claimed it would. This is because advertisements often use exaggerated or unrealistic images to make their claims, and the product that is actually sold to consumers may not be as good as the image portrayed in the advertisement.

Overall, I agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. A lot of the time, the images that are used in advertisements are edited in a way that makes the product look better than it is in reality, and the product that is actually sold to consumers may not be as good as the image portrayed in the advertisement.

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as the method of electing the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is vital for preserving the integrity and representation of our democratic process. In this letter, I will outline the importance of the Electoral College, address counterarguments, and provide evidence from multiple sources to support my claim.

The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers, was a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and election by popular vote of qualified citizens. It is a meticulous process consisting of the selection of electors, their meeting to vote for President and Vice President, and the eventual counting of electoral votes by Congress. This system ensures that each state has a voice in the election by allocating electors based on each state’s entitled allotment. Additionally, the District of Columbia is treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College, as outlined in the Constitution (""What Is the Electoral College?"").

One of the main arguments against the Electoral College is that it does not always align with the national popular vote. However, this discrepancy has occurred rarely throughout history. In 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency due to the electoral vote. While this may seem unfair, it is essential to consider the practical reasons for retaining the Electoral College. Firstly, it provides certainty of outcome, as the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that a dispute over the outcome is less likely to occur, compared to a potential dispute over the popular vote (""In Defense of the Electoral College"").

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents the entire nation by requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a President, preventing candidates from focusing solely on certain regions. This prevents regional candidates from being elected who may not have the broader appeal necessary to be an effective President. It also guarantees that residents of all regions feel represented and that their votes count in the election (""In Defense of the Electoral College"").

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome is uncertain. This makes voters in these states more attentive and thoughtful in their decision-making, as they know their votes will have a significant impact on the election. Focusing on swing states allows candidates to engage with a diverse range of voters, understand their concerns, and develop policies to address them (""In Defense of the Electoral College"").

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances political weight between large and small states. The malapportionment of the Senate in the Constitution means that large states have less representation compared to their population. However, the Electoral College mitigates this by giving larger states more attention during campaigns. This ensures that candidates address the needs and concerns of citizens living in both large and small states, creating a more balanced representation of the nation as a whole (""In Defense of the Electoral College"").

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the problem of run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This process reduces the complexity of the presidential election and ensures a clear winner. Run-off elections can prolong the uncertainty and decision-making process, potentially leaving the nation without a President for an extended period (""In Defense of the Electoral College"").

While the popular vote is a crucial aspect of any democracy, changing to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States would undermine the principles and benefits provided by the Electoral College. It is worth noting that even in states where a candidate may have no hope of winning, voters still have incentives to express their political preferences through their vote (""In Defense of the Electoral College"").

In conclusion, the Electoral College is an integral part of our democratic process. It ensures representation and balance between states, encourages candidates to engage with a broad range of voters, and provides a system that has historically produced clear and certain outcomes. While there may be arguments in favor of a popular vote, the Electoral College remains a viable and valuable means of electing our nation's leader. I urge you to consider these points in any discussions or decisions regarding the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"While many may argue for it, the Electoral College has proved to be an obsolete way of electing the President. It is, essentially, an indirect way for voters to choose their candidates, by voting for electors whose loyalty is not guaranteed. The Electoral College vote can override the popular vote, as seen in the 2000 Presidential Election. Some say that the Electoral College is a system worth keeping, because it provides a certain outcome and avoids runoff elections, yet these arguments are founded on little reason.

Undoubtedly outdated, this system is a catastrophe in the works, the 2000 election only a glimpse of the chaos that could result from the Electoral College. The disaster factor is a strong argument against the Electoral College. Consider 1960, when Louisiana segregationists came close to replacing Democratic electors with ones who wouldn't support Kennedy 11. Also along those lines, electors are bound by nothing but obligation to vote for the candidate of their party, and sometimes change their decision upon voting. Even if it only happens occasionally, it is yet another fault in this system.

Not only is the Electoral College irrational, it is also simply unfair. Each state can only cast a single vote, so the one representative in Wyoming, who represents only 500 thousand, would have as much say as California's 55 representatives, who represent 35 million voters 12. Other sources say a tie would be unlikely. However, in 1979 in Ohio, it would have only taken a few thousand voters to vote the other way 12. Because of the ""winnertakeall"" system, certain states are left untouched by candidates who know they won't win them. In 2000, certain states didn't even see the candidates, and didn't air campaign ads, denying voters of a chance to further favor or favor them 13.

It is simple, the Electoral College system is a turnoff for many voters, especially after the incident in 2000 when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote. Voters can be discouraged if they have no hope of carrying their state, like Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in Cali 23. Assuming that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election 23"" is rather incorrect. Single votes could absolutely sway an election, as mentioned earlier. Relying on the popular vote may make a tie more likely, but it would free voters from an obsolete and untrustworthy system. Over 60 percent of voters oppose the Electoral College 9 which is enough to bring attention to these facts and, hopefully, address them before another controversial occurance.

The evidence is all layed out, mishaps and nearmishaps, an impending catastrophe all too possible for comfort, unfair to potential voters. The Electoral College doesn't deserve its defenders. 2000 proved it, the voters have spoken up, and it is indisputably irrational to continue to rely on it. The system has been around for a while, and it will stay in place for the next few years, most likely. However, because of the light now being shined on its faults, it could have a chance to be reformed for the better.",0
"There are many reasons to believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. First, a well-rounded education provides a more complete perspective and understanding of the world. A person who knows a little about a lot of things is better equipped to see the interconnectedness of all knowledge and to make connections between disparate fields. Second, a broad education provides a greater range of career options. A person with a broad range of knowledge is not limited to a single career path but can choose from a variety of jobs that require different skill sets. Finally, a broad education is more likely to lead to a lifetime of learning. A person who is exposed to a variety of subjects is more likely to be curious and to continue learning throughout their life.

There are, of course, some advantages to specializing in a single subject. Specialization can lead to a deeper understanding of the subject matter and to greater expertise. Specialization can also make a person more marketable in their chosen field. However, these advantages are outweighed by the advantages of a broad education. A well-rounded education is more likely to lead to a successful and fulfilling life.

"When it comes to the importance of physical education, there is no question that it is an essential part of a student's life. Physical education provides students with the opportunity to learn about both their individual and collective physical potentials. It helps them develop body awareness and teaches them how to use their bodies in a safe and effective manner. This knowledge can then be transferred over into other aspects of life such as school, work, or social activities. Physical education encourages healthy habits in children from an early age by helping them understand why particular activities are important for maintaining proper health - whether through teaching concepts like nutrition or managing stress through physical activity. During class time, teachers provide instruction on various topics such as anatomy, biomechanics, exercise physiology, motor development theory and skill-related fitness components (agility/balance/coordination etc.). In addition to this traditional classroom learning experience there are also outdoor activities which allow students to put what they have learned into practice while enjoying themselves at the same time. For those who struggle with mental health issues like anxiety or depression – physical education can play an integral role in providing relief from symptoms due to its ability to facilitate improved mood states through increased endorphin production brought on by exercise routines designed specifically for individuals’ needs; these benefits extend beyond just feeling better but will also impact cognitive function positively affecting areas such as memory recall and reasoning skills which may help individuals reach their full academic potentials more easily when enough attention is paid towards one’s mental well-being alongside their academic goals in tandem. . . On top of all this beneficial insight gained during physical education classes–students transitioning back into “normalcy” after periods away from traditional schooling would benefit greatly upon returning especially if they had long breaks where excessive outside recreational activity was not possible as reintroducing oneself slowly back into movement-based activities has been proven time again not only improve overall positive feelings associated with being physically active but also facilitates healthier attitudes towards

"I believe that the university education is more than just preparing students for employment. It is a place where students can learn about different subjects and develop their skills. For example, a student might learn how to write a research paper or how to speak in front of a group. These skills can be useful in any type of job.

Another function of the university education is to give students a sense of community. They can meet new people and learn about different cultures. This is important because it helps students to understand the world around them. It also helps them to be tolerant and understanding.

Finally, the university education can help students to develop their own ideas. They can learn how to think critically and come up with their own ideas. This is important because it helps them to be successful in life.

"There are a lot advantages and disadvantages of limiting car usage around the world but let's talk about the advantage of limited car usage right now if cars were limited there are a lot of great things that can happen for one greenhouse gases emissions will reduce drastically, the streets will be more safer no more accidents, people will save more money from not buying a car, crime rate will go down, and people can get exercise if they walked or biked to places instead.

Firstly, if cars get limited then greenhouse gas effect will go down that means less pollution and to destory the ozone layer which means a lot of pollution needs to disappear if we don't want the hole in the ozone layer to get bigger then it already is which means more UV light is coming in from the sun because our protection is slowly being eatten away from all this pollution that means we can get burned more easily from the sun and eventually the world can catch fire more easily when even more UV gets in that is why a lot more forests are getting burned it's because all of this dry weather doesn't mix well with a lot of UV light coming in and also all forests can destoryed and not come back and the animals will go extinct .

Secondly, if cars are limited the streets will be safer because less and less people are driving that means no more hit and runs, drunk driving, accidents in the road to cause a blockage making people late or stuck for an hour or so, less lives taken, no more traffic, no more texting and driving, no more cras explosions or fires to cause anymore damage, kids will be able to play more often outside then inside, and no more damage to buildings.

Thirdly, if cars are limited people will have more money if they buy a car a lot of people in the United States are having financial issues where they don't have money to pay certain bill or get things that they need because they have a car which means gas money when it needs gas, when gotten into an accident you gotta pay to get it fixed while its being fixed you gotta get a rental car, and when it breaks down and doesn't work anymore you haft to get a new one but if cars were limited money will be easier to save.

Fourthly, if cars are limited then people can get exercise obesity has increased over the years because of all of the fatty food we have people are gaining weight fast and it doesn't help that people have cars which makes it easier to get around and get even more food to stuff their faces with but if cars get limited then people can either bike or walk to places giving them the excercise they need to lose all that weight and obesity rates will go down and everyone will be healthy and not a lot of people will die from a heartattack.

Finally, if cars were limited then crime rates will go down that means less DUIs, no more theft of cars, theft of household items, hit and run, speed chases, drive by shootings, life will be safer when cars are off the streets, worry free environment, and people won't haft to worry about getting objects getting destoryed in any wreckage of a criminal who is running away from the police.

In conclusion, if cars get limited pollution will drop, no more accidents on the street, financial issues will go away, crimes will slowly go away, and obesity rates will go down from the excersise that people will get if cars were limited people could live a simple life, worry free but they can't because no one stops the productions of cars that people are afraid of because they are dangerous to people and the world so it would be easier if cars didn't exsist.",0
"In the United States we have been voting for president for many decades. But now there are protest against the process of electing a president. Many argue that the electoral college should be abolished and others feel that we should elect by popular vote. I strongly believe that we should change to popular vote because the electors could defy peoples will, they are unfair to voters, and people arent necessarily voting for their president.

To begin with, the electors have the power to defy peoples will. State legislators are responsible for picking electors and those electors can defy the will of people. ""Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their partys candidate and cast a deciding for whomever they please."" said Bradford Plumer.This is not right because the legislatures are picking electors that are using their powers for the worst.

Next,the electoral college is unfair to the voters. "" Because of the winnertakesall system in each state,candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" said Plumer. For example , during the 2000 campaign only 17 states didnt see the candidates all, that includes Rhode Island and South Carolina. Electoral colleges are not being fair to the states and their voters.

Lastly, the election process should be changed to popular vote because voters are necessarily voting for the president. Most people think that when they go to vote for their president that their votes are what decides the final outcome, but thats not true!.Its the electoral college that decides that. Some people dont vote for that reason , because they dont think that their vote will change anything. And in the end it does not seem very fair that are votes count by very little.

In conclusion, the way we elect are president every four years should be changed. It should go based on popular vote not on electoral college because elector could defy people, they are unfair to voters , and people arent necessarily voting for their president. For all the reason people should be able to vote and they will know that their vote will be counted.",0
"Has asking other people for advice worked out for you? IÃÂ´ve seen many great outcomes of people taking advice from others, but some people still question it. From my own personal experience people have taken my advice, and things would work out for me if I took theirs. Asking multiple people for advice can help, because they can give you a new perspective of the problem, and you can listen to each opinion and choose the best one for your solution.

Imagine if you switched bodies with somebody for a day. WouldnÃÂ´t you be curious as to how they live your life.

Hearing a different perspective of the story may solve your problem. You could tell your friend about an argument you had and ask what you should do about it. They might give you new ideas or parts of the story that you didnÃÂ´t even think about. Their ideas and opinions on the situation could be the answer that you need. There might be parts of the issue that you looked over or didnÃÂ´t see where you were in the wrong for what you did. That new perspective can give you a huge realization towards everything and it can give you a new perspective as well.

Usually people donÃÂ´t want to hear other peopleÃÂ´s opinions, but this may be the one time that they do. Listening to each of those solutions and opinions from different people will probably help the most. Out of all of the opinions you might hear, you know which one is best for you. This way you have multiple options and can probably see how they would end. I also think that peopleÃÂ´s answers to your situation may be different based on what you are to them. For example, what if you asked your best friend, your mom, and your grandma for advice on whether or not you should go to the mall. Your friend tell you that you should go so that you guys can hang out. Your mom would tell you to go but after you finish your chores and your grandma would probably say yes because you need to live life to the fullest. All advice may be great, but itÃÂ´s still based on your decision and what you choose to do.

In my opinion, some of the best advice I have gotten has been from other people and I think that theyÃÂ´ve really helped me make good decisions in life. Not saying that it would work out for everyone but just saying it has been helpful. In conclusion, advice you get from others may be some of the best advice that you will get, but it depends on if you choose to use take it or not.",0
"I agree that it is a grave mistake to theorize before one has data. It is important for people to gather data first before forming any opinions or theories about a particular topic. This is because theories are based off of the evidence that is collected, and if there is no data to back up the theory then it may be inaccurate or even wrong. Without data, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions and make well-informed decisions.

To illustrate, let's take the example of a research study. Let's say a researcher is interested in studying the effects of a certain diet on weight loss. If they simply theorize without gathering any data, then their conclusions will be based off of assumptions and speculation rather than facts. They won't know if their diet is effective in promoting weight loss or if it has any side effects. Furthermore, without data, they won't be able to make any meaningful comparisons or draw any valid conclusions.

Similarly, if a business were to theorize without any data, they would be unable to make informed decisions about their products or services. For example, let's say a company wants to launch a new product. Without data on customer preferences, they won't know what features customers want or if the product will be successful in the market. Furthermore, without data, they won't be able to determine the best pricing strategy or the ideal target market for the product.

The importance of data to inform decisions is also evident in politics. Politicians need data to make informed decisions about important issues such as the economy, healthcare, and the environment. Without data, it would be impossible for them to know the effects of their policies or to gauge the public opinion on certain topics. Data also plays an important role in helping politicians craft effective policies that reflect the concerns and needs of the people.

In summary, it is a grave mistake to theorize before one has data. This is because theories are based off of the evidence that is collected, and without data, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions and make well-informed decisions. Therefore, it is important for people to gather data first before forming any opinions or theories about a particular topic.

"Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned citizen and constituent, I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as the method used to elect the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College continues to be the most effective and fair approach for a variety of reasons.

One of the primary reasons to maintain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. In the Electoral College system, the winning candidate's share of electoral votes always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the President has a clear mandate and legitimacy, reducing the likelihood of disputes and challenges to the election results.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in the election. With each state having a certain number of electors, candidates are compelled to campaign in all states, including those with smaller populations. This prevents candidates from exclusively focusing on heavily populated urban areas and ensures that the concerns and interests of all Americans are taken into account.

In addition, the Electoral College serves to protect the interests of smaller states and less populated regions. It balances the weight that large states hold due to their representation in the House of Representatives, providing a fair voice to states with smaller populations. This helps to prevent the domination of the presidency by a few highly populated states, ensuring a more geographically diverse leadership.

Another advantage of the Electoral College system is its ability to prevent run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges, avoiding the need for costly and time-consuming run-offs. This allows for a more efficient and streamlined election process, ultimately benefiting the American people.

While some argue that the popular vote system would be more democratic, it is important to note that the Electoral College remains a representative process. When we cast our votes for a presidential candidate, we are actually voting for a slate of electors who will then make the final decision. This indirect method of selection allows for the consideration of regional interests and ensures that our democracy remains balanced and fair.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has served our nation well for over two centuries, providing a stable and equitable method for electing the President. It creates certainty in the outcome, gives a voice to all regions of the country, protects the interests of smaller states, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is a system that balances democracy and representation, ensuring that the President is elected in a way that is fair, legitimate, and reflective of the diverse interests of our nation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the importance of preserving the Electoral College and vote in favor of maintaining this vital component of our democracy.

Sincerely,

"The thought of limting car usage may sound ridiculous or even out right absurd to some, however, what if one car not driving could save your city or even country? Emissions from cars have been weathering away at the Earth's atmosphere and trapping health threatening green house gasses. Goverments have taken notice of this and are developing programs to curve the increasingly large amount of emissions and other air pollutants that come from cars.

In the source,""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" it tells the tale of Vauban, Germany and other places that have similar programs to limit or ban car usage in suburban homesteads. As a result of the new rule, nearly 70 percent of the families who live in Vauban, though its completely legal, do not own a car and an additional 57 percant sold theirs to move into the square mile of suburbian life. Since the completion of the suburb in 2006, this trend has grown and spread out across Europe and America. These are great things to hear considering that 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from the tailpipe of the passenger cars that occupy Europe. Additionally, the greenhouse gasses in the United States can reach as much as 50 percent in heavily automobile trodden areas like Detroit, Los Angeles and New York. These cities may have their rescue soon enough as the Enviromental Protection Agency has pushed for legislative action to aid their fellow Americans.

In another European landmark, Paris has joined the fight to battle the smog that glooms over the fantasmic city. Although the city looks like it is a paradise, it actually has a smog predicament comparable to that of Shanghai which is notorious for its near cancerous smog problem. To combat this arising problem in Paris, city officials have instituted rules and bans against the pollutants. Motorists with even numbered license plates will alternate with odd numbered motorists every day and the city will provide free transportation Monday through Friday to those banned on that day. Not only has it help impede the incoming smog, it has also cleared traffic congestion up to 60 percent! This is also a benifit in the smog battle since motorists aren't idling and producing emissions when at a standstill. This idea has also been shared to other places around the world that are trying to battle their own emissions.

The struggle for clean air is even in our own back yard. President Obama has even addressed it himself last week as it came out that Americans are buying less cars and driving the ones they already have less. Now this may sound a bit astounding considering that Americans have a passion for cars. In Detroit,, Michigan, companies who are internationally known for their cars have their base of operations lacted in the sprawlng urban playground. The first mass produced automobile, the Ford Model-T, was even crafted right here in the United States! However,  there is still a noticeable decline in the use of cars in American lives. This isn't all bad though, some of Americas cities are falling into a danger that other cities across the globe have already fallen for; smog and greenhouse gas pollution.

There are numerous studies on the health risks of air pollutants that can back up the reasoning of countless goverments and cities that want to undo their own demise. In the final source titled, ""The End Of Car Culture"", the passage states that,"" Many Sociologists believe it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions..."" This statement comes after the news of declines in Americans driving their own cars. This atop of new drivers not wanting their licenses and prefer public transit are unknowingly an aid to fighting the global emission dilema.

The advantages of limiting car usage has both positives and its negatives. The negative only affects one person, usually, and the positives have an affect on everyone else's health and the global enviroment and make countless other minute differences in the world. The global effort to inhibit the production of smog. greenhouse gas emissions, and any other pollutant that makes the quality of air unfavorable has really come along way in the past few decades since its realization. So why not hang up the keys once in a while and take a bus to the store or walk to work.",0
"Modern day technology can identify human emotions. One very strong claim and great example is the 3D computer model. It begins when the computer constructs the model of a human face or painting.

Leonardo da Vinci, a famous artist, painted The Mona Lisa, but new technology computer software can recognize emotion, according to Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. The 3D computer model can construct all 44 major muscles in the humans body, but it must move like human muscles. The movent of one or more muscles during this process is called an ""action unit"". According to Dr. Huang, ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal"", even though some individuals often show varying degrees of expression.

When using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software can track facial movements in a real face in a student or painting. Weighing in different units, the software can identify mixed emotions because each experssion is compared against a neutral face. For instance, in person, you can probably tell how someone is feeling simply by the look on his/her face. Scientists and Professors today would go over types of human emotions through the 3D computer model.

The home PC you own can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's or any humans smile. The Facial Action Coding System only enables lab computers or computers at a University to identify human emotions. This same technology is used to make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery.

In conlusion, modern day technology can identify human emotions through a 3D computer or The Facial Action Coding System. The value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions is very valuable and can be used to express how someone feels. I'm 100% for the use of this technology becuase this is a one of a kind new age technology.",0
"I am against the value of using the Facial Action Coding System because some people may try to hide a feeling like be upset or sad because they don't know how to tell someone why and how they feel. Just because they are hiding what they feel doesn't mean that someone can take new technology and found out what their feeling, because if they wanted people to know how they felt they would.

On the other hand if you use the technlogy you could change a lesson if a student was becoming bored or confused to help them do better in school. This technology could help more students pass classes so they can graduate. But some may not like the thought of someone being able to look at a computer and finding out what they are feeling.

They need to respect what people feel and not try to figure what is wrong because they didn't want to tell. If they found out they person may get upset and by confused at what happened. Using this could cause people to be disapointed in what people are feeling. This could cause people to get angry at others. Just because the technology exists doesn't mean that you have to use it.

I believe that the Facial Action Coding Stsyem shouldn't be use. This is because people may not want others to know want they feel, if they did they would tell them. But if they just told they wouldn't need the Facial Action Coding System. Some students may be struggling with things and may talk but what they are feeling but if they are confused they could just ask for help. Just because students dont show their feelings doesn't mean that they won't when they are ready. You should let people express their feelings at their own time not by using technology that could tell what someone is feeling. Using this technology would cause to be frustrated even more because they can't tell people what they feel on their own because the technology would tell people ins't and not when the person is ready to tell people what they feel.",0
"One of the most important skills of English for Chinese learners is still largely debated. While some people think that reading should be given priority, others argue that speaking should be emphasized instead. In my opinion, speaking should be given priority over reading for Chinese learners.

To begin with, speaking English is essential for Chinese learners as it allows them to connect with native speakers and gain a better understanding of the language. Speaking English gives Chinese learners the opportunity to practice the language in real-time, as it requires them to apply the knowledge they have acquired from their reading. Speaking also allows Chinese learners to interact with native English speakers and learn the nuances of the language, such as slang and idioms, that are difficult to pick up from simply reading. In this way, Chinese learners will be able to express themselves accurately and confidently in English.

Moreover, speaking English is a more practical skill as it is used more frequently than reading. For example, when Chinese learners are travelling abroad, they will need to be able to converse with native speakers to get directions and ask for help. In addition, many professions require the ability to speak English, so learning to speak the language is important if the learners want to pursue their career.

Finally, speaking English is essential for Chinese learners to build confidence. As they practice and improve their speaking skills, they will be able to engage in conversations with more ease and feel more confident about speaking the language. This, in turn, will make them more motivated to continue learning the language and improve their fluency.

In conclusion, although reading is important for Chinese learners, speaking should be given priority over reading. Speaking English allows them to gain a better understanding of the language, be more practical and build their confidence.

"Facial Action Coding Software, or FACS, is an impressive software. It has the ability to to scan someone's face, and then analyze it to come up with calculatedpercentages of said person's emotion. I believe, however, a computer with this capability has little to no value in a classroom.

First, the article does specifically state ""Your home PC cannot handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Most schools do not have anything stronger than a home PC because they cannot afford it. Next, Dr. Huang predicts ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This prediction could come true, assuming that all classrooms are devoid of any teachers.

The article also states many other jobs this program could do without replacing humans in workplaces. For instance, FACS could be used by news organizations to tell if politicians are lying or not. Another example stated in the article is using this software to select ads on the web that you will like. And finally, in paragraph 9, it says according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, that smiling may not only express emotions, but create them. The author asks ,""Did making a happy face in this experiment also make you feel slightly happier?"" On the other hand, wouldn't seeing another human make the expression cause the emotion to be a little bit more powerful, rather than having a robot tell you to?

In conclusion, because the computers needed to run the facial software are not cost effective, there are other jobs it can do without replacing teachers, and it is better to smile because you see something that makes you smile, I believe a computer software capable of reading human emotion through facial expressions has no place in a classroom.",0
"Was the Face on Mars created by aliens?

Do you think the face on Mars was created by aliens? I don't... and that's because it's to many reasons that prove it's not. I'm a scientist at NASA and I helped prove these reasons. We found that it is just a butte or a mesa, aliens are not even real, and there is no life on Mars.

It has been proven that it is just a butte or a mesa, this is what the picture actually shows....landforms. A friend my mine, Garvin says that is reminds him of ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" that's here on Earth. So that states that we have the resources to prove it is a mesa!

It has been proven aliens are not even real. I mean people ""say"" they have seen one and even took pictures of them, but that doesn't mean they are real. We have not yet seen or even captured one for testing yet which proves that they are not real. This person who tells me that they ""think"" aliens created this face doen't even know if it's true. Therefore this is just a thought that is not true.

On another note there is no life on Mars, as proven by us (NASA). We have tested for air and a way we could live there without holding a oxegen tank around and there is no way. People think we are hiding if there is any life on Mars and if the face was created by aliens, but why would we let the World know that we were even researching about life on Mars or that we even found a face on Mars if we didn't want the World to know? Yes, we've done research over and over again to prove to the World that there is no life on Mars and that the face is just a mesa, so we ask that the World believes us and keep the peace.

I have given my reasons why aliens did not create this face on Mars, and you may or may not agree, just please I ask you to keep the peace.",0
"Has the thought about limiting car usage not only in the United States but within the entire world ever occured to you?

Whether it has or hasn't there are many advantages to limiting the usage of your car.

To begin with this whole idea about cutting the rate of car usage down is mainly to take away stress, lower air pollution, make cities denser and better for walking, to make suburbs more compact and accesible to public transportation, to curb green house gas emissions,etc..

As of right now in Germany, an expirimental new district located on the outskirts of Freiburg is now a car-free community. The only automobiles located within a rectangle square mile, are trams, busses but no cars. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban,s families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car just to move here."" (Elisabeth Rosenthal). The basic percepts of this one expiriment are being adopted around the whole world in attempts to drastically reduce green house gas emissions from the tail pipes of cars. In paris the same thing is happening except for a different reason. Paris is trying to cut down the use of cars due to the amount of smog that the diesel from the car creates. ""Paris typically has more smog than any other European capital."" (Robert Duffer) Paris even enforced a ""partial"" driving ban in order to try and clear the smog from the air of the global city. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five days of intensifying smog."" After a few weeks this ban cut down the amount of smog drastically to where the smog actually ended up moving toward Beiging, China, otherwise known as the most polluted city in the world. A major crisis in Bogata , Colombia also drove them to create a program that is set to spread to other countries to make them aware of the harmful things pollution from a car tailpipe can do to you.

So in conclusion, limiting the amount of car usage really isn't a bad thing. For one,  it has more advantages than disadvantages and it is alternatively a new ideal way of life. With this you will become a healthier person, you will be less stressed out, you will eventually notice that the life you were once living as a stressed out person with a car that you believed made your life easier actually made your life a living chaos. So why wait, go ahead and adjust your life to live with a better lifestyle, and spread the word about decresing the amount of car usage so that one day the whole world can be healthier and happier too.",0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

I am writing to express my support for keeping the current Electoral College system in place for the election of the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote method, I believe that the Electoral College provides several key benefits that are essential for our democracy.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As mentioned in the Office of the Federal Register's text, a dispute over the outcome of the Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in most states creates a landslide electoral-vote victory, reducing the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that all regions have a say in the election. As Judge Richard A. Posner highlights, the requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal prevents candidates from solely focusing on their stronghold regions. This encourages candidates to campaign and listen to the concerns of voters across the country, promoting national unity and inclusivity.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system encourages meaningful engagement from voters. The focus on swing states, as seen in the 2012 election, leads to more attention being given to these states by candidates, resulting in voters being more informed and thoughtful in their decision-making process. This engagement and active participation are crucial to a well-functioning democracy.

The Electoral College also provides a balance of power between small and large states. As mentioned by Judge Posner, the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance to large states, which can lose influence due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. By awarding electoral votes based on population, larger states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, ensuring their interests are not overshadowed by smaller states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast, run-off elections could significantly complicate the electoral process. The Electoral College, on the other hand, consistently produces a clear winner, maintaining a streamlined and efficient election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate has no hope of winning, it is important to note that voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preferences rather than to swing the outcome of the entire election. The high voter turnout in the 2012 election, despite knowing their vote may not have a national impact, demonstrates the commitment of the American population to express their political preferences.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides certainty, regional balance, meaningful engagement, power balance between states, and avoids run-off elections. These benefits are essential for a successful and fair presidential election process. I urge you to consider these factors when evaluating the debate on whether to keep the Electoral College or change to a popular vote system. Maintaining the Electoral College is vital to preserving the integrity and effectiveness of our democratic process.

Thank you for your time and consideration of my views on this important matter.

Sincerely,

"Almost everyone 16 years old and older has a cell phone. It is often hard to find a teenager without one attached to them. This has created some problems for those operating a vehicle. Cell phones have caused many issues for people on the highway and should not be allowed by those operating a vehicle.

Most of everybody have a cell phone most people life go around a cell phone. Cell phone causes many problems while driving, you can look away for one minute and end up having an accident. The National Safety Council report 1.6 million crashes every year. Almost 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents while texting and driving.

Texting while driving has become a very big problem in today worlds. People check they phones every 5 minutes and faster than that when they are driving. Texting and driving don't just affect you when you driving it effect the other people in the car and the person you had the accident with. The average amount of time a driver takes to type out a text message is 5 seconds. If you're driving 55 mph and look down to text for five seconds, you've already driven the length of a football field. 11 teenagers die every day due to texting and driving. Teenagers are 400% more likely to get into an accident from texting and driving. AT&T's Teen Driver Survey found that 97% of teenagers think it's dangerous, while 43% of them engage in the activity anyway

While driving you shouldn't do anything but drive, let the person on the passenger side handle the music and send texts out. 520 pedestrians have been killed by distracted drivers. Mostly teens who text and drive, It's not that important they can wait living life better than sending a text and a risking your life.",0
"The planet that some call the ""Evening Star,"" Venus, is the closest planet to Earth at points in time. Despite the hostile and dangerous environment, the close proximity and sustainable innovations outweigh the challenges and open up many doors for research of one of Earth's neighbors. Long ago, Venus was most likely the most similar planet to Earth in the solar system.

In looking at the development and changes that Venus has gone through, the planet's past may turn into Earth's future. Though right now the atmosphere contains ""almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets,"" and the surface averages over ""800 degrees Fahrenheit,"" it has features found on Earth as well. These include ""rocky sediment...valleys, mountains, and craters."" Analyzing this enviroment more closely would allow for a deeper understanding of Venus, and may fufill the curiosity of scientists wondering what Earth's ""twin"" truly is like.

As the conditions of the planet were described brutally by the author, his claim for the investigation of Venus is strongly supported. Providing different propositions, he appeals to the cautious and ambitious readers. First, an idea is presented with scientists floating more than 30 miles above the ground conditions, giving insight on the planet below. With this, safety is the prominent factor. However, it makes it difficult to obtain effective pictures, and the ground can not be analyzed. A solution to this is found in the chemistry of silicon carbide, having the ability to last in Venus's conditions for three weeks. If this project was put into action, the author tells of how they would be able to obtain samples of the land, photograph and gain insight on the planet. A similar idea is rooted in the toughness of mechanical computers with more resistance to ""pressure, heat, and other forces"" that could be found from problematic obstacles on Venus.

In his final argument, the author tells how travels on Earth and beyond ""should not be limited by dangers and doubts,"" instead ""expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" With this, a statement is made to fight for advancing knowledge of the unknown. Overall, in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author gives facts to both sides, but gives more support to show why it is a worthy mission despite the risks.",0
"The president of the united states is one of the most powerful political leaders in the world and controls the faith of one of the wealthiest country on the planet. There have been many discussions on how to elect the president of such a great nation. The Electoral College, the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. If its worked for over 200 years why change it. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome and avoids runoff elections and should be kept as the form of election of the U.S. president of our state.

To Begin With, the Electoral College has been used for more than 200 years and our state is fighting for another 200 years of electoral college. In an article by Richard A. Posner called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President"" he states ""there are...reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons."" Amongst these reasons one of them is the certainty of outcome and in source 3 paragraph 18 it states that ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reasons is that the winning candidates share of the popular vote."" Richard Posner is stating that Electoral College is more effective because it causes less trouble and does not need to be disputed unlike popular vote which needs to be disputed because the winning candidates share of the Electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

Furthermore, The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. In an article by Richard A. Posner called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President"" he says ""nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College 301 and 370. There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invariably produces a clear winner.",0
"There is no denying that medical care and education are important aspects of society that the government should invest in. However, I believe that the government should also invest in building theaters and sports stadiums. Here are three reasons why I believe this to be true.

First, theaters and sports stadiums provide entertainment and recreation for citizens. This is important because it helps to improve the quality of life for people. It can be difficult to live in a society that is constantly working and never taking the time to relax and enjoy life. By providing entertainment and recreation, theaters and sports stadiums help people to relax and enjoy themselves.

Second, theaters and sports stadiums can help to generate revenue for the government. This is important because it can help to offset the cost of other government programs. For example, if the government spends money on building a theater, they can then charge people to use the theater. This can help to generate revenue that can be used to fund other government programs.

Third, theaters and sports stadiums can help to promote tourism. This is important because it can help to bring money into the local economy. When people come to visit a theater or a sports stadium, they will often spend money on food, lodging, and other items. This can help to boost the local economy and create jobs.

In conclusion, I believe that the government should invest in building theaters and sports stadiums. This is because they can help to improve the quality of life for citizens, generate revenue for the government, and promote tourism.

"The life of an astronaut is one that has fascinated people for ages. While the idea of venturing beyond our planet seems like a daunting task, those who bravely take on the challenge do so with courage and determination. As such, it is important to appreciate their sacrifices and dedication as they explore space in order to further humanity's knowledge. Becoming an astronaut requires much more than simply having dreams of outer space exploration. It takes hard work, dedication, and commitment over many years in order to be accepted into training programs by NASA or other organizations. These programs are incredibly selective due to the demanding nature of being an astronaut - applicants must have a wide array of skills including physical endurance, mental capacity and dexterity as well as fluency in multiple languages. After acceptance into these rigorous programs, astronauts then go through long periods of intense physical training which includes cognitive tests; simulations; specialized equipment familiarization; water-survival classes; spacewalk preparation sessions; and mission specific tasks studies - all necessary elements for them to become competent at performing their duties aboard spacecrafts without issue during missions outside Earth’s atmosphere. . Once trained up sufficiently enough to qualify for flights into orbit around Earth or even farther out away from us humans here on Earth they get assigned various missions depending on their individual abilities/specialties (medical doctors may help conduct scientific experiments while others may focus more on repair). The amount time spent in space varies depending on the duration/difficulty level associated with each assignment but can range anywhere from weeks up months at a time!. Throughout this period astronauts undergo extensive psychological testing times before embarking upon any journey outside our home planet - because when you’re that far away from everything we know & love there isn't much room error either mentally or physically if something goes wrong during Mission Control won't be able too reach its target unless every contingency imaginable has been preplanned/accounted for ahead beforehand!. .

"Did you know on Mars there is a face? Some people think it was created by aliens. Other people think it is just a natural landform on Mars. The face on Mars was first discovered in 1976.

When they first saw it it looked like a ""shadowy likeness of a human face"". It was an enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end. When they first discovered it they saw it staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. I am going to be telling you why this is just a natural landform on Mars.

When scientist first saw it in 1976, they thought it was just another Martian mesa which is common around Cydonia. They knew is was some type of landform. A few days later, NASA unvieled the image for all to see. The caption was ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head"". The only reason they said it was aliens, was to get people's attention. That is exaclty what it did.

Eventually on April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over to Cydonia for the first time to check it out. While they were there Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the original photos. When the image first apperared on a JPL web site it revealed it was just a natural landform and there was no alien monument after all. Not everyone was convinced it was just a landform. Many people still thought it had something to do with aliens. But, how could aliens have done it? No one knows.

On April 8,2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew a close enough second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view,""Garvin stated. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size"", Garvin added. ""So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" he added. They could tell there was nothing just the land its self. It could not have been aliens.

What the pictures they actually took show is a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common in the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"", Garvin says. Garvin ended his statement with,""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Coming to a conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Even Garvin, the Mars Global Surveyor said it himself,""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivlent of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West"". The Face on Mars is really, just an natural landform.",0
"The using of of this new technology called the Facial Action Coding Systems should be used to read the emtional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. This technology can help many students in need without having to ask the teacher or professor for help. The students wont need to feel ashamed about asking a questionfor help because with this technology it'll make things more clearly for you to understand.

In the text it states it explains to you how this new technology can scan your facial recognitions and can tell how you're feeling. First the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of your face and all 44 major muscles in the modele must move like human muscles. In the text it states, ""Eckman has classified the six basic emotions which are happines, surprise,anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" All these emotions are associated with the characteristics movements of your facial muscles. Some examples he talks about is when you're surprised your frontalis pars lateralis muscle above your eyes are raised; another one is when your orbicularis oris, around your mouth tightens your lips to show anger. This software can identify misex emotions and each expresion is compared to a neutral face that shows no emotion.

This new technology advancement would be able to recognize one's emotions but we can't always rely on technology. For instance we don't need technology to know when a friend is sad but we can just recongize their expresions by simply looking t their face. This technology can also be misleadng, In the text it states, ""A classroom computer could recgnize when a student is becomine confusef or bored..Then it culd modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor."" Yes this technology can read facial expressions but can they truly understand why we are feeling this way or whats going on through our head. We can be in class learning a lesson but you can be confused about not what you're learning but of something else that's going across your head. Like any other technology. this new technology can work both ways a student it can either help them or bring them down.

Much of the human communication is nonverbal which includes emotional communications, so computers need to understand that too. This technology is basically based upon the muscular action units one gives away. In the text states, ""They even indicate the difference between a geneuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sude ways using the zygomatic major and and a different muscle, the risorius."" They say faces don't lie, so this technology would be able to read even the fake smile you put on.

The Facial Action Coding System may help the students in many different ways. It can help them with a lesson that they don't quite understand or confused about. It can recognize if youre truly happy or faking or any oter emotions you may be feeling. Yes you know how you are felling but this technology can help give you the confidence you need. This system shows how it can improve one's life by it understanding your facial muscles that give away your expressions. You won't be ashamed to ask questions nor be laughed at because this technology will help you without you realizing it. While you're confused on the lesson this technology would modify the lesson like an effective human instructor so you'll understand the lesson mre.",0
"It is equivalent to a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west. Garvin says that its just the shading of the area that makes it look like a face. Over the years the face changes it starts to change shape or crust over and because of that it makes it look like a natural landform. NASA wouldn't have sent it out if they really thought is was alien. Some people think that the face is a bona fide for evidence that there is life on mars, but NASA would hide that information. they only sent the image out to get more peoples attention towards mars. They most likely sent out on the web to stir up peoples thoughts and to make them nervous about if there really is life on mars.

In 1976 you can sort of tell that there is a face on the rock formation. In 1998 you can really tell that there is a face there, but you can also see a change in lighting which because of that you can see the face more. In 2001 there is no lighting like the first one but its at a different angle so with the lighting on the second one it blocks out the cracks so its ageing over time and that proves that its a rock formation.",0
"The modern age of technology is often thought to be a blessing and a curse. On one hand, the advancements that have been made in the world of computers, smartphones, and other digital products can make our lives easier and more efficient; on the other hand, these same technologies can lead to feelings of disconnection from nature and an overall decrease in mental health. This essay will explore how smartphones are changing our relationship with nature by creating a sense of detachment as well as providing potential tips for reducing this detachment while still using technology responsibly. It’s no secret that smartphone use has skyrocketed over recent years – many people now find themselves constantly scrolling through social media feeds or glued to their phones during down time rather than connecting with their physical environment around them. In some cases, it seems easier for us to stay engaged with what’s happening online rather than taking the initiative to go outside and spend time outdoors. By spending too much time looking at screens instead of basking in natural light (or even just breathing fresh air) we greatly reduce our chances of feeling fulfilled and connected with nature - something crucial for mental health development as well as general wellbeing. Unfortunately there isn't any easy fix-all solution when it comes to managing screen time or improving connection with nature - but there are a few things that could help alleviate this growing issue: first off prioritizing “screen free activities” such as reading books or listening podcasts outside instead; staying mindful about your daily phone usage; setting up specific times throughout the day where you pledge not to look at your phone; or simply unplugging altogether every once in awhile – all great ideas which could create positive changes both mentally & physically! Additionally having conversations with friends/family members about reducing screen time can also serve beneficial towards developing healthier phone habits by holding each other accountable. At its heart technology provides numerous benefits across various aspects of life however it's important not forget how vital it is maintain balance

Ralph Waldo Emerson famously wrote that, ""Life is a journey, not a destination."" This simple statement succinctly captures the importance of exploring beyond our comfort zones. In order to truly lead a fulfilled life, it is necessary to be willing to take risks, be open to new experiences, and try the things that challenge us. Doing so will yield tremendous rewards, both personally and professionally. 

One great example of a person who stepped outside of their comfort zone and achieved amazing success is Oprah Winfrey. After rising up from an impoverished childhood, Oprah created an entire media empire despite not having any previous experience in the television and film industries. She took a risk, believed in her dreams, and ended up creating history with her tremendous success. 

Another example of taking a leap of faith outside of one’s comfort zone is drawn from my own personal experience. When I was younger, I was incredibly shy and introverted and was always nervous and afraid to try new things. However, once I made the conscious effort to step out of my comfort zone, I have achieved more confidence and have gone on to accomplish some of my biggest life goals. 

Ultimately, the best approach is to embrace the idea of continuing to explore and push limits. As Emerson said, “Do the thing you fear, and the death of fear is certain.” Exploring beyond our comfort zones will always lead to personal growth and a deeper understanding of ourselves and our world.",1
"The advantages of limiting car usage would be less pollution, less traffic, and less money involved. For example, in the German suburbs, large garages that are at the end of development where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. So cut down cost on that Germany people have given up their cars.

Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. That doesn't mean that car ownership is not aloud but there is only two places to park, large garages and homes. This cuts down on money costs for Germany by a long shot because with no cars then people don't have to spend money on gas, and Germany's streets will be safe without the cars messing up the roades and less car accidents will occur. Although citics may say that it will be difficult for people to get around, it stands that people are just happier this way. For example, Heidrum Walter is a media trainer and a mother of two says, ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""

In Paris, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city, after days of near-record pollution. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). Same for the odd-numbered plates the following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. Which is an effective way to lessen pollution in Paris since it is so polluted in the first place. They also said it was easier to imagine than a car-free Champs-Elysees. Doing this got them great results as well, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five days of intensifying smog, which is rivaled by Beijing, China for being known as one fo the most polluted cities in the world. The smog was cleared enough on Monday for the ruling French party to recind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

In Bogota, Colombia millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day. Which left the Colombian streets devoid of traffic jams. Traffic jams are pretty annoying and no one wants to go through them so making up a day like this is extremely good for the environment and for your phyci as well. If people would violate this day they would get charged $25 fines. Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" so doing this day it would make people more relaxed and happy but also be good to the enviroment just like in Germany.

In the end of the day, it is important to know that all of these things these countries are doing are for the good of the world. It is good that it is more of a mandatory participation then a optional objective so that people won't take global warming seriously even though it is.",0
