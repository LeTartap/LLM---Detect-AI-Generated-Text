## Introduction

AI-generated content is becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it challenging to distinguish between genuine and computer-generated text. Our project aims to tackle this issue by leveraging the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to identify and flag AI-generated text segments. Whether you're dealing with chatbots, articles, or social media posts, our solution offers accurate detection, ensuring the authenticity of digital content.

## Features

- **BERT-Powered Detection:** We utilize state-of-the-art BERT models to analyze the semantic context and linguistic nuances, enabling precise identification of AI-generated text.
- **Effortless Integration:** Seamlessly integrate our solution into your existing applications or workflows, ensuring hassle-free implementation for developers and researchers.
- **High Accuracy:** Our model is meticulously trained and fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy, minimizing false positives and false negatives for reliable results.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** With intuitive interfaces and clear instructions, users can easily navigate and utilize the detection tool without any technical expertise.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get started with our AI-Generated Text Detection tool:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-generated-text-detection.git
   cd ai-generated-text-detection
   ```
   
- **Access the generated submission.csv file to explore the detected AI-generated text segments and their respective confidence scores.**

## How It Works

Our solution follows a comprehensive approach to AI-generated text detection:

**Data Preprocessing:** We clean and preprocess the textual data, removing noise and irrelevant information to enhance the accuracy of our model.

**BERT Tokenization:** Leveraging the BERT tokenizer, we encode the preprocessed text, preparing it for input into our detection model.

**Model Training:** Using a BERT-based sequence classification model, we train the system to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated text with a high degree of accuracy.

**Predictions:** Once trained, the model generates predictions for test data, highlighting potential AI-generated content segments.

**Result Analysis:** The results are saved in a CSV file, allowing users to review and analyze the detected segments along with their confidence scores.
